We know from the problem that:\n   \\[\n   U_M = 16 \\quad \\text{(number of Urban Residential Area's Mitsuwa Marketplace)}\n   \\]\n\n2. The number of College Town's Vons equals 9 more than the difference between Fashion District's Vons and Urban Residential Area's Mitsuwa Marketplace:\n   \\[\n   C_V = (F_V - U_M) + 9\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( U_M \\) with 16, we get:\n   \\[\n   C_V = (F_V - 16) + 9\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   C_V = F_V - 7\n   \\]\n\n3.

We know that College Town's Supermarkets (represented by \\( C_S \\)) are related to Urban Residential Area's Supermarkets by some factor. However, since we are only interested in the count of College Town's Supermarkets and are not given an explicit link between Supermarkets and the number of Vons in College Town, we need to keep \\( C_S \\) as it is.\n\nGiven that we don't have further information about any direct connection in counts for \\( C_S \\), \\( U_S \\), or \\( F_S \\), we conclude that:\n- The number of Supermarkets in College Town is simply represented by \\( C_S \\).\n\nSince we must finalize our answer as a single integer between 0 and 22, and based on the operations involved in obtaining our solution:\n- We don't have specific counts for each \\( C_S, U_S, \\) or \\( F_S \\) without further information. Assuming the simplest case of \\( U_S = 0 \\) leads to:\n\\[\nC_V = 0 + 13 = 13\n\\]\n\nThis makes the count of College Town's Supermarkets equal to 13 (the count of Vons), which seems logical given the relationships derived.\n\nTherefore, the final answer, representing the quantity of Supermarkets in College Town as a single integer fitting within the stated range, is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{13}\n\\]",
