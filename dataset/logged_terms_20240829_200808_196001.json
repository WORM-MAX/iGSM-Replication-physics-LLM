  "question": "District category contains Learning Hub, Gated Community, Civic Center, and Administrative District.\nSupermarkets category contains Sainsbury's, Target, and Hannaford.\nProduct category contains Juice, Rice Cakes, and Pies.\nThe number of each Target 's Rice Cakes equals 15.\nThe number of each Civic Center 's Target equals 19 times the sum of each Sainsbury's 's Pies, each Target 's Rice Cakes, and each Learning Hub 's Hannaford.\nThe number of each Sainsbury's 's Juice equals the sum of each Target 's Juice and each Administrative District 's Hannaford.\nThe number of each Learning Hub 's Hannaford equals the difference of each Hannaford 's Product and each Administrative District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Hannaford 's Juice equals 15.\nThe number of each Sainsbury's 's Rice Cakes equals 10 more than the sum of each Target 's Rice Cakes, each Administrative District 's Hannaford, and each Target 's Juice.\nThe number of each Gated Community 's Sainsbury's equals the difference of each Sainsbury's 's Juice and each Administrative District 's Hannaford.\nThe number of each Administrative District 's Hannaford equals 0.\nThe number of each Learning Hub 's Sainsbury's equals each Hannaford 's Juice.\nThe number of each Civic Center 's Hannaford equals the difference of each Hannaford 's Product and each Hannaford 's Juice.\nThe number of each Sainsbury's 's Pies equals the sum of each Administrative District 's Hannaford and each Hannaford 's Juice.\nThe number of each Target 's Juice equals 16 more than each Administrative District 's Hannaford.\nHow many Hannaford does Civic Center have?",
  "solution": "Define each Hannaford 's Juice as N; So N = 15.\nDefine each Hannaford 's Product as c; So c = N = 15.\nDefine each Civic Center 's Hannaford as w; So w = c - N = 15 - 15 = 0.\n",
