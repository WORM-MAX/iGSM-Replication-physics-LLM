  "question": "District category contains Embassy Row, and Market District.\nSupermarkets category contains Coles (Australia), and Central Market.\nThe number of each Market District 's Central Market equals each Market District 's Coles (Australia).\nThe number of each Market District 's Coles (Australia) equals 6.\nThe number of each Embassy Row 's Central Market equals 8.\nHow many Supermarkets does Market District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Market District 's Coles (Australia) as C; So C = 6.\nDefine each Market District 's Central Market as L; So L = C = 6.\nDefine each Market District 's Supermarkets as N; So N = C + L = 6 + 6 = 12.\n",
