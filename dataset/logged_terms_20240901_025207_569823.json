  "question": "District category contains Education Park, Housing Estate, and Legal District.\nSupermarkets category contains HelloFresh, Whole Foods Market, and Dollar General.\nThe number of each Legal District 's Whole Foods Market equals 20.\nThe number of each Housing Estate 's Whole Foods Market equals 5 more than each Legal District 's Whole Foods Market.\nThe number of each Education Park 's HelloFresh equals 14 more than each Legal District 's Whole Foods Market.\nHow many Supermarkets does Education Park have?",
  "solution": "Define each Legal District 's Whole Foods Market as w; So w = 20.\nDefine each Education Park 's HelloFresh as f; So f = 14 + w = 14 + 20 = 11.\nDefine each Education Park 's Supermarkets as T; So T = f = 11.\n",
