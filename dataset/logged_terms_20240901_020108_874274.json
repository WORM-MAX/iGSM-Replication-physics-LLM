  "question": "District category contains Ancient City, and Medical District.\nSupermarkets category contains Shipt, and Hungryroot.\nProduct category contains Herbal Tea, and Canned Fruits.\nThe number of each Hungryroot 's Canned Fruits equals 15 times each Ancient City 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Shipt 's Canned Fruits equals 0 more than each Ancient City 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Ancient City 's Shipt equals 6.\nThe number of each Hungryroot 's Herbal Tea equals 1 more than each Ancient City 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Ancient City 's Hungryroot equals 8 times each Ancient City 's Shipt.\nThe number of each Shipt 's Herbal Tea equals 18 times the sum of each Ancient City 's Shipt and each Hungryroot 's Canned Fruits.\nThe number of each Medical District 's Hungryroot equals 16 more than each Hungryroot 's Product.\nThe number of each Medical District 's Shipt equals 17.\nHow many Supermarkets does Medical District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Ancient City 's Shipt as v; So v = 6.\nDefine each Ancient City 's Hungryroot as F; So F = 8 * v = 8 * 6 = 2.\nDefine each Ancient City 's Supermarkets as n; So n = v + F = 6 + 2 = 8.\nDefine each Hungryroot 's Herbal Tea as K; So K = 1 + n = 1 + 8 = 9.\nDefine each Hungryroot 's Canned Fruits as G; So G = 15 * n = 15 * 8 = 5.\nDefine each Hungryroot 's Product as r; So r = K + G = 9 + 5 = 14.\nDefine each Medical District 's Hungryroot as L; So L = 16 + r = 16 + 14 = 7.\nDefine each Medical District 's Shipt as s; So s = 17.\nDefine each Medical District 's Supermarkets as j; So j = s + L = 17 + 7 = 1.\n",
