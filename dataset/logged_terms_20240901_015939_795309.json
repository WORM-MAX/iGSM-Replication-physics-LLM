  "solution": "Define each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Auchan as M; So M = 10.\nDefine each Auchan 's Alcoholic Beverages as K; So K = M = 10.\nDefine each Auchan 's Canned Mushrooms as W; So W = M - K = 10 - 0 = 0.\nDefine each Auchan 's Product as a; So a = W + K = 0 + 0 = 0.\nDefine each Medical District 's Auchan as k; So k = a = 0.\nDefine each Senior Living Community 's Blue Apron as A; W = k - M = 0 - 10 = 13; So A = 4 + W = 4 + 13 = 17.\nDefine each Blue Apron 's Canned Mushrooms as j; A = k + W = 0 + 13 = 13; So j = 11 + A = 11 + 13 = 1.\nDefine each Blue Apron 's Pizza Dough as r; q = K - A = 0 - 13 = 10; So r = 1 + q = 1 + 10 = 11.\nDefine each Blue Apron 's Product as Q; So Q = j + r = 1 + 11 = 12.\nDefine each Senior Living Community 's Lidl as B; So B = 18 + Q = 18 + 12 = 7.\nDefine each Senior Living Community 's Supermarkets as E; So E = A + B = 13 + 7 = 20.\n",
