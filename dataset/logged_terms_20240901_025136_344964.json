  "question": "District category contains Shopping District, Business District, and Military District.\nSupermarkets category contains Blue Apron, and Costco.\nThe number of each Military District 's Blue Apron equals 21 more than each Business District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Shopping District 's Blue Apron equals each Military District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Business District 's Costco equals 19.\nHow many Supermarkets does Military District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Business District 's Costco as y; So y = 19.\nDefine each Business District 's Supermarkets as I; So I = y = 19.\nDefine each Military District 's Blue Apron as L; So L = 21 + I = 21 + 19 = 17.\nDefine each Military District 's Supermarkets as n; So n = L = 17.\n",
