  "solution": "Define each Housing Estate 's Wegmans as H; So H = 20.\nDefine each Sainsbury's 's Canned Corn as L; So L = 18 * H = 18 * 20 = 15.\nDefine each Big Lots 's Canned Corn as u; So u = 14 * L = 14 * 15 = 3.\nDefine each Tech Park 's Big Lots as S; So S = 0 * u = 0 * 3 = 0.\nDefine each Housing Estate 's Big Lots as l; f = S + H = 0 + 20 = 20; So l = 13 * f = 13 * 20 = 7.\nDefine each Housing Estate 's Sainsbury's as k; So k = 2 * l = 2 * 7 = 14.\n",
