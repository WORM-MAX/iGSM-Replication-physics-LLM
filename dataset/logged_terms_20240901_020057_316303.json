  "question": "District category contains Archaeological District, Medical District, and High School Zone.\nSupermarkets category contains The Fresh Market, Makro, and Trader Joe's.\nProduct category contains Rolls, Yogurt, and Bread.\nIngredient category contains Saffron, Ginger, and Barley.\nThe number of each The Fresh Market 's Yogurt equals 8.\nThe number of each Makro 's Yogurt equals 3.\nThe number of each Rolls 's Saffron equals 6 more than each Makro 's Yogurt.\nThe number of each Medical District 's The Fresh Market equals the sum of each Trader Joe's 's Yogurt and each Bread 's Barley.\nThe number of each Trader Joe's 's Yogurt equals 0.\nThe number of each Yogurt 's Saffron equals 12.\nThe number of each Bread 's Barley equals 19 more than each Trader Joe's 's Yogurt.\nThe number of each High School Zone 's Trader Joe's equals the sum of each Trader Joe's 's Yogurt and each Bread 's Barley.\nThe number of each Archaeological District 's Makro equals 14 times the difference of each Makro 's Product and each Makro 's Yogurt.\nHow many Product does Archaeological District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Makro 's Yogurt as C; So C = 3.\nDefine each Makro 's Product as N; So N = C = 3.\nDefine each Archaeological District 's Makro as n; F = N - C = 3 - 3 = 0; So n = 14 * F = 14 * 0 = 0.\nDefine each Archaeological District 's Product as o; o = N * n = 3 * 0 = 0.\n",
