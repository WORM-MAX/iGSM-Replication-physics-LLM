  "question": "District category contains Arts District, and Gated Community.\nSupermarkets category contains Weis Markets, and Save-A-Lot.\nThe number of each Arts District 's Weis Markets equals 20 more than each Arts District 's Save-A-Lot.\nThe number of each Gated Community 's Weis Markets equals each Arts District 's Save-A-Lot.\nThe number of each Arts District 's Save-A-Lot equals 8.\nThe number of each Gated Community 's Save-A-Lot equals the sum of each Arts District 's Save-A-Lot, each Arts District 's Supermarkets, and each Gated Community 's Weis Markets.\nHow many Supermarkets does Arts District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Arts District 's Save-A-Lot as z; So z = 8.\nDefine each Arts District 's Weis Markets as j; So j = 20 + z = 20 + 8 = 5.\nDefine each Arts District 's Supermarkets as U; So U = j + z = 5 + 8 = 13.\n",
