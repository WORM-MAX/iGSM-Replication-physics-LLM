  "question": "District category contains Government Complex, and Housing Estate.\nSupermarkets category contains Blue Apron, and Auchan.\nThe number of each Housing Estate 's Blue Apron equals 14.\nThe number of each Government Complex 's Blue Apron equals the sum of each Housing Estate 's Blue Apron, each Housing Estate 's Auchan, and each Housing Estate 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Housing Estate 's Auchan equals each Housing Estate 's Blue Apron.\nThe number of each Government Complex 's Auchan equals 5 times the sum of each Housing Estate 's Blue Apron, each Housing Estate 's Auchan, and each Housing Estate 's Supermarkets.\nHow many Supermarkets does Government Complex have?",
  "solution": "Define each Housing Estate 's Blue Apron as o; So o = 14.\nDefine each Housing Estate 's Auchan as t; So t = o = 14.\nDefine each Housing Estate 's Supermarkets as F; So F = o + t = 14 + 14 = 5.\nDefine each Government Complex 's Blue Apron as X; F = t + o = 14 + 14 = 5; So X = F + F = 5 + 5 = 10.\nDefine each Government Complex 's Auchan as y; s = t + o = 14 + 14 = 5; E = F + s = 5 + 5 = 10; So y = 5 * E = 5 * 10 = 4.\nDefine each Government Complex 's Supermarkets as s; So s = y + X = 4 + 10 = 14.\n",
