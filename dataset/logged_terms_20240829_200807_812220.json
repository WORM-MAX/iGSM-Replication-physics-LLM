  "question": "District category contains Condo District, Heritage District, and Preservation District.\nSupermarkets category contains Stop & Shop, and Lidl.\nThe number of each Preservation District 's Lidl equals each Condo District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Preservation District 's Stop & Shop equals each Condo District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Condo District 's Lidl equals 20 more than each Condo District 's Stop & Shop.\nThe number of each Condo District 's Stop & Shop equals 10.\nThe number of each Heritage District 's Stop & Shop equals 15 times each Condo District 's Stop & Shop.\nThe number of each Heritage District 's Lidl equals the sum of each Condo District 's Lidl and each Condo District 's Stop & Shop.\nHow many Supermarkets does Preservation District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Condo District 's Stop & Shop as l; So l = 10.\nDefine each Condo District 's Lidl as d; So d = 20 + l = 20 + 10 = 7.\nDefine each Condo District 's Supermarkets as V; So V = d + l = 7 + 10 = 17.\nDefine each Preservation District 's Lidl as O; So O = V = 17.\nDefine each Preservation District 's Stop & Shop as c; So c = V = 17.\nDefine each Preservation District 's Supermarkets as E; So E = O + c = 17 + 17 = 11.\n",
