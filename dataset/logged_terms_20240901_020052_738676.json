  "question": "District category contains Research and Innovation Park, Courthouse District, and Tech Park.\nSupermarkets category contains Food 4 Less, Family Dollar, and Target.\nThe number of each Research and Innovation Park 's Food 4 Less equals 3 more than each Courthouse District 's Food 4 Less.\nThe number of each Tech Park 's Food 4 Less equals 2.\nThe number of each Tech Park 's Target equals 13 more than each Research and Innovation Park 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Courthouse District 's Target equals 16 more than each Tech Park 's Family Dollar.\nThe number of each Courthouse District 's Food 4 Less equals 15 times each Tech Park 's Food 4 Less.\nThe number of each Courthouse District 's Family Dollar equals 14.\nThe number of each Tech Park 's Family Dollar equals the sum of each Courthouse District 's Food 4 Less, each Tech Park 's Food 4 Less, each Research and Innovation Park 's Food 4 Less, and each Tech Park 's Target.\nHow many Target does Tech Park have?",
  "solution": "Define each Tech Park 's Food 4 Less as Z; So Z = 2.\nDefine each Courthouse District 's Food 4 Less as x; So x = 15 * Z = 15 * 2 = 7.\nDefine each Research and Innovation Park 's Food 4 Less as Q; So Q = 3 + x = 3 + 7 = 10.\nDefine each Research and Innovation Park 's Supermarkets as e; So e = Q = 10.\nDefine each Tech Park 's Target as W; So W = 13 + e = 13 + 10 = 0.\n",
