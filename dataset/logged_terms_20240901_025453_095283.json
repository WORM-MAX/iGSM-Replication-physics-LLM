  "question": "District category contains Business District, Gated Community, and Student Housing.\nSupermarkets category contains E.Leclerc, Instacart, and Shipt.\nProduct category contains Ice Cream, Whipped Cream, and Muffins.\nThe number of each Gated Community 's Shipt equals the sum of each Instacart 's Whipped Cream and each Student Housing 's Shipt.\nThe number of each Instacart 's Muffins equals 21 more than the sum of each Instacart 's Whipped Cream, each Student Housing 's E.Leclerc, and each Shipt 's Ice Cream.\nThe number of each E.Leclerc 's Muffins equals each Shipt 's Muffins.\nThe number of each Gated Community 's E.Leclerc equals 18 more than the sum of each Business District 's Instacart and each Shipt 's Muffins.\nThe number of each Student Housing 's Shipt equals each Shipt 's Muffins.\nThe number of each E.Leclerc 's Whipped Cream equals the difference of each Student Housing 's Shipt and each Shipt 's Muffins.\nThe number of each Shipt 's Ice Cream equals 11.\nThe number of each Instacart 's Whipped Cream equals the sum of each Student Housing 's E.Leclerc and each Shipt 's Ice Cream.\nThe number of each E.Leclerc 's Ice Cream equals 2 more than each Instacart 's Product.\nThe number of each Gated Community 's Instacart equals 11.\nThe number of each Business District 's Shipt equals 19.\nThe number of each Shipt 's Muffins equals 22.\nThe number of each Business District 's Instacart equals 3.\nThe number of each Shipt 's Whipped Cream equals the sum of each Instacart 's Product and each Shipt 's Muffins.\nThe number of each Business District 's E.Leclerc equals the difference of each Instacart 's Product and each Student Housing 's Shipt.\nThe number of each Instacart 's Ice Cream equals 8.\nThe number of each Student Housing 's Instacart equals each Shipt 's Muffins.\nThe number of each Student Housing 's E.Leclerc equals 17 more than each Shipt 's Ice Cream.\nHow many Ice Cream does E.Leclerc have?",
  "solution": "Define each Shipt 's Ice Cream as x; So x = 11.\nDefine each Student Housing 's E.Leclerc as v; So v = 17 + x = 17 + 11 = 5.\nDefine each Instacart 's Whipped Cream as S; So S = v + x = 5 + 11 = 16.\nDefine each Instacart 's Muffins as q; Z = v + x = 5 + 11 = 16; P = S + Z = 16 + 16 = 9; So q = 21 + P = 21 + 9 = 7.\nDefine each Instacart 's Ice Cream as g; So g = 8.\nDefine each Instacart 's Product as C; B = q + S = 7 + 16 = 0; So C = g + B = 8 + 0 = 8.\nDefine each E.Leclerc 's Ice Cream as j; So j = 2 + C = 2 + 8 = 10.\n",
