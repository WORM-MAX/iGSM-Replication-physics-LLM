  "question": "District category contains Tech Park, Jewelry District, Business District, and Shopping District.\nSupermarkets category contains Kroger, Stop & Shop, Eataly, and Central Market.\nThe number of each Jewelry District 's Stop & Shop equals each Shopping District 's Central Market.\nThe number of each Shopping District 's Kroger equals 19 times each Tech Park 's Central Market.\nThe number of each Tech Park 's Stop & Shop equals 11.\nThe number of each Shopping District 's Central Market equals 17.\nThe number of each Tech Park 's Central Market equals 4 times each Shopping District 's Central Market.\nThe number of each Jewelry District 's Eataly equals 20.\nThe number of each Business District 's Eataly equals the sum of each Jewelry District 's Supermarkets and each Shopping District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Business District 's Kroger equals 18 more than each Jewelry District 's Eataly.\nHow many Supermarkets does Tech Park have?",
  "solution": "Define each Shopping District 's Central Market as Z; So Z = 17.\nDefine each Tech Park 's Central Market as n; So n = 4 * Z = 4 * 17 = 22.\nDefine each Tech Park 's Stop & Shop as S; So S = 11.\nDefine each Tech Park 's Supermarkets as C; So C = S + n = 11 + 22 = 10.\n",
