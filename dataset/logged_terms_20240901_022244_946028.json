  "question": "District category contains Historic Neighborhood, and High-rise Apartment Complex.\nSupermarkets category contains Vons, and Morrisons.\nProduct category contains Popcorn, and Flavored Water.\nThe number of each Morrisons 's Popcorn equals 19 times each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Vons.\nThe number of each Historic Neighborhood 's Morrisons equals 9.\nThe number of each Historic Neighborhood 's Vons equals the difference of each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Vons and each Vons 's Flavored Water.\nThe number of each Vons 's Flavored Water equals each Historic Neighborhood 's Morrisons.\nThe number of each Morrisons 's Flavored Water equals the sum of each Vons 's Flavored Water, each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Vons, and each Historic Neighborhood 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Vons equals 18.\nThe number of each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Morrisons equals each Morrisons 's Popcorn.\nHow many Product does Vons have?",
  "solution": "Define each Historic Neighborhood 's Morrisons as y; So y = 9.\nDefine each Vons 's Flavored Water as u; So u = y = 9.\nDefine each Vons 's Product as s; So s = u = 9.\n",
