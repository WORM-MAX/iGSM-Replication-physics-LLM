  "question": "District category contains Institute District, and Capitol District.\nSupermarkets category contains Piggly Wiggly, and Hungryroot.\nProduct category contains Alcoholic Beverages, and Yogurt.\nThe number of each Piggly Wiggly 's Yogurt equals the difference of each Hungryroot 's Product and each Institute District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Hungryroot 's Yogurt equals 21 times the difference of each Piggly Wiggly 's Alcoholic Beverages and each Capitol District 's Piggly Wiggly.\nThe number of each Hungryroot 's Alcoholic Beverages equals 4.\nThe number of each Capitol District 's Piggly Wiggly equals 6 times the sum of each Piggly Wiggly 's Alcoholic Beverages, each Institute District 's Hungryroot, and each Institute District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Institute District 's Hungryroot equals 17.\nThe number of each Capitol District 's Hungryroot equals 1.\nThe number of each Piggly Wiggly 's Alcoholic Beverages equals 10 more than each Institute District 's Supermarkets.\nHow many Piggly Wiggly does Capitol District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Institute District 's Hungryroot as j; So j = 17.\nDefine each Institute District 's Supermarkets as A; So A = j = 17.\nDefine each Piggly Wiggly 's Alcoholic Beverages as K; So K = 10 + A = 10 + 17 = 4.\nDefine each Capitol District 's Piggly Wiggly as v; U = A + j = 17 + 17 = 11; G = K + U = 4 + 11 = 15; So v = 6 * G = 6 * 15 = 21.\n",
