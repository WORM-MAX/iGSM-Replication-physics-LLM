  "question": "District category contains Academic District, Medical District, and Arts District.\nSupermarkets category contains Dollar General, H-E-B, and Auchan.\nProduct category contains Buttermilk, Canned Artichokes, and Brownies.\nThe number of each Arts District 's H-E-B equals each Auchan 's Canned Artichokes.\nThe number of each Dollar General 's Canned Artichokes equals the sum of each Auchan 's Canned Artichokes, each H-E-B 's Brownies, and each Academic District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each H-E-B 's Canned Artichokes equals the sum of each Dollar General 's Canned Artichokes, each Academic District 's Auchan, each Dollar General 's Brownies, and each Academic District 's H-E-B.\nThe number of each Arts District 's Auchan equals the sum of each Academic District 's Dollar General, each Dollar General 's Buttermilk, and each Auchan 's Brownies.\nThe number of each H-E-B 's Brownies equals 9 times the sum of each Medical District 's H-E-B and each Auchan 's Canned Artichokes.\nThe number of each Academic District 's Auchan equals 12.\nThe number of each H-E-B 's Buttermilk equals 5.\nThe number of each Auchan 's Canned Artichokes equals the sum of each Academic District 's Auchan, each Academic District 's Supermarkets, and each Academic District 's H-E-B.\nThe number of each Medical District 's H-E-B equals the sum of each Dollar General 's Buttermilk, each Academic District 's Dollar General, and each Academic District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Academic District 's H-E-B equals 5 more than the difference of each Academic District 's Auchan and each Academic District 's Dollar General.\nThe number of each Dollar General 's Brownies equals 19.\nThe number of each Dollar General 's Buttermilk equals each Auchan 's Canned Artichokes.\nThe number of each Medical District 's Auchan equals the sum of each Dollar General 's Buttermilk, each Dollar General 's Product, each Auchan 's Canned Artichokes, and each Arts District 's H-E-B.\nThe number of each Auchan 's Brownies equals each Dollar General 's Brownies.\nThe number of each Academic District 's Dollar General equals each Academic District 's Auchan.\nThe number of each Auchan 's Buttermilk equals each Dollar General 's Canned Artichokes.\nHow many Brownies does H-E-B have?",
  "solution": "Define each Academic District 's Auchan as p; So p = 12.\nDefine each Academic District 's Dollar General as J; So J = p = 12.\nDefine each Academic District 's H-E-B as S; W = p - J = 12 - 12 = 0; So S = 5 + W = 5 + 0 = 5.\nDefine each Academic District 's Supermarkets as i; z = p + J = 12 + 12 = 1; So i = S + z = 5 + 1 = 6.\nDefine each Auchan 's Canned Artichokes as v; t = S + p = 5 + 12 = 17; So v = i + t = 6 + 17 = 0.\nDefine each Dollar General 's Buttermilk as K; So K = v = 0.\nDefine each Medical District 's H-E-B as q; X = J + i = 12 + 6 = 18; So q = K + X = 0 + 18 = 18.\nDefine each H-E-B 's Brownies as x; c = q + v = 18 + 0 = 18; So x = 9 * c = 9 * 18 = 1.\n",
