  "solution": "Define each Shopping District 's Metro (Canada) as O; So O = 9.\nDefine each Shopping District 's Stop & Shop as L; So L = O = 9.\nDefine each Shopping District 's Supermarkets as z; So z = L + O = 9 + 9 = 18.\nDefine each Metro (Canada) 's Yogurt as C; So C = 17 + z = 17 + 18 = 12.\nDefine each Fresh Thyme Market 's Cookies as s; So s = C = 12.\nDefine each Fresh Thyme Market 's Product as F; So F = s = 12.\n",
