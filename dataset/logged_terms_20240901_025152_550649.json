  "solution": "Define each Save-A-Lot 's Chocolate Covered Pretzels as g; So g = 9.\nDefine each Single-family Homes 's Giant Eagle as E; So E = 21 * g = 21 * 9 = 5.\nDefine each Giant Eagle 's Ice Cream as I; P = E + g = 5 + 9 = 14; So I = 10 + P = 10 + 14 = 1.\nDefine each Medical District 's Giant Eagle as a; o = g + E = 9 + 5 = 14; So a = I + o = 1 + 14 = 15.\nDefine each Giant Eagle 's Product as u; So u = I = 1.\nDefine each Medical District 's Product as R; R = u * a = 1 * 15 = 15.\nDefine each Loblaws 's Ice Cream as q; So q = 9 * R = 9 * 15 = 20.\n",
