  "question": "Background: There are 2 types of District: Old Town, and Heritage District.\nThere are 2 types of Supermarkets: Wegmans, and PriceRite.\nThere are 2 types of Product: Canned Vegetables, and Half-and-half.\nThere are 2 types of Ingredient: Polenta, and Fennel Seeds.\nEach Old Town has Wegmans.\nEach Heritage District has Wegmans and PriceRite.\nEach Wegmans has Canned Vegetables.\nEach PriceRite has Canned Vegetables.\nEach Canned Vegetables has Polenta.\nEach Half-and-half has Polenta.\nThe number of each Heritage District 's Wegmans equals 22 more than the sum of each Heritage District 's PriceRite and each Wegmans 's Product.\nThe number of each Wegmans 's Canned Vegetables equals 4 more than the difference of each Half-and-half 's Polenta and each Heritage District 's PriceRite.\nThe number of each Old Town 's Wegmans equals the sum of each Heritage District 's Ingredient, each Canned Vegetables 's Polenta, and each Heritage District 's Product.\nThe number of each PriceRite 's Canned Vegetables equals the sum of each Heritage District 's PriceRite and each Half-and-half 's Polenta.\nThe number of each Canned Vegetables 's Polenta equals the sum of each Heritage District 's Product and each Heritage District 's Wegmans.\nThe number of each Half-and-half 's Polenta equals 12.\nThe number of each Heritage District 's PriceRite equals 3 times each Half-and-half 's Polenta.\nHow many Ingredient does Old Town have?",
  "solution": "Define each Half-and-half 's Polenta as c; So c = 12.\nDefine each Heritage District 's PriceRite as k; So k = 3 * c = 3 * 12 = 13.\nDefine each Wegmans 's Canned Vegetables as F; y = c - k = 12 - 13 = 22; So F = 4 + y = 4 + 22 = 3.\nDefine each Wegmans 's Product as r; So r = F = 3.\nDefine each PriceRite 's Canned Vegetables as M; So M = k + c = 13 + 12 = 2.\nDefine each Heritage District 's Wegmans as E; Y = k + r = 13 + 3 = 16; So E = 22 + Y = 22 + 16 = 15.\nDefine each PriceRite 's Product as u; So u = M = 2.\nDefine each Heritage District 's Product as G; Z = k * E = 13 * 15 = 11; L = u * r = 2 * 3 = 6; So G = Z + L = 11 + 6 = 17.\nDefine each Canned Vegetables 's Polenta as a; So a = G + E = 17 + 9 = 9.\nDefine each Canned Vegetables 's Ingredient as J; So J = a = 9.\nDefine each Wegmans 's Ingredient as o; o = J * F = 9 * 3 = 4.\nDefine each PriceRite 's Ingredient as z; z = M * J = 2 * 9 = 18.\nDefine each Heritage District 's Ingredient as w; g = k * E = 13 * 9 = 2; N = z * o = 18 * 4 = 3; So w = g + N = 2 + 3 = 5.\nDefine each Old Town 's Wegmans as C; M = a + G = 9 + 17 = 3; So C = w + M = 5 + 3 = 8.\nDefine each Old Town 's Ingredient as K; K = o * C = 4 * 8 = 9.\n",
