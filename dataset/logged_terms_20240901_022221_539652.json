  "question": "District category contains Market District, and Financial District.\nSupermarkets category contains Stop & Shop, Aldi (Germany), and Lidl.\nThe number of each Financial District 's Lidl equals 14 more than each Market District 's Lidl.\nThe number of each Market District 's Aldi (Germany) equals 6.\nThe number of each Market District 's Stop & Shop equals each Financial District 's Lidl.\nThe number of each Market District 's Lidl equals 7.\nThe number of each Financial District 's Aldi (Germany) equals 22 more than each Financial District 's Lidl.\nHow many Aldi (Germany) does Financial District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Market District 's Lidl as E; So E = 7.\nDefine each Financial District 's Lidl as w; So w = 14 + E = 14 + 7 = 21.\nDefine each Financial District 's Aldi (Germany) as q; So q = 22 + w = 22 + 21 = 20.\n",
