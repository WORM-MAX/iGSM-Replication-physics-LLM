  "question": "District category contains Media District, Condo District, and Financial District.\nSupermarkets category contains Food Lion, Piggly Wiggly, and Central Market.\nThe number of each Financial District 's Piggly Wiggly equals 1 more than the sum of each Media District 's Supermarkets and each Condo District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Media District 's Central Market equals 1.\nThe number of each Condo District 's Central Market equals 21.\nThe number of each Media District 's Piggly Wiggly equals the difference of each Condo District 's Supermarkets and each Condo District 's Central Market.\nHow many Supermarkets does Financial District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Condo District 's Central Market as G; So G = 21.\nDefine each Condo District 's Supermarkets as N; So N = G = 21.\nDefine each Media District 's Piggly Wiggly as I; So I = N - G = 21 - 21 = 0.\nDefine each Media District 's Central Market as u; So u = 1.\nDefine each Media District 's Supermarkets as H; So H = I + u = 0 + 1 = 1.\nDefine each Financial District 's Piggly Wiggly as C; z = H + N = 1 + 21 = 22; So C = 1 + z = 1 + 22 = 0.\nDefine each Financial District 's Supermarkets as w; So w = C = 0.\n",
