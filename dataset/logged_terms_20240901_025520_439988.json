  "question": "District category contains Education Park, Restaurant District, and School District.\nSupermarkets category contains Lidl, and Tesco.\nThe number of each School District 's Lidl equals 21 times each Restaurant District 's Lidl.\nThe number of each Restaurant District 's Tesco equals the sum of each School District 's Supermarkets, each Restaurant District 's Lidl, and each School District 's Lidl.\nThe number of each School District 's Tesco equals the difference of each Restaurant District 's Lidl and each School District 's Lidl.\nThe number of each Restaurant District 's Lidl equals 16.\nThe number of each Education Park 's Tesco equals 0.\nThe number of each Education Park 's Lidl equals 2.\nHow many Tesco does Restaurant District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Restaurant District 's Lidl as a; So a = 16.\nDefine each School District 's Lidl as F; So F = 21 * a = 21 * 16 = 14.\nDefine each School District 's Tesco as D; So D = a - F = 16 - 14 = 2.\nDefine each School District 's Supermarkets as X; So X = D + F = 2 + 14 = 16.\nDefine each Restaurant District 's Tesco as B; Q = a + F = 16 + 14 = 7; So B = X + Q = 16 + 7 = 0.\n",
