  "question": "District category contains Academic District, and Preservation District.\nSupermarkets category contains Carrefour, and Amazon Fresh.\nProduct category contains Ice Cream, and Beer.\nIngredient category contains Hoisin Sauce, and Maple Syrup.\nThe number of each Academic District 's Carrefour equals 0 more than each Ice Cream 's Maple Syrup.\nThe number of each Academic District 's Amazon Fresh equals each Ice Cream 's Maple Syrup.\nThe number of each Preservation District 's Carrefour equals 6.\nThe number of each Carrefour 's Beer equals 15.\nThe number of each Preservation District 's Amazon Fresh equals 7 more than each Ice Cream 's Maple Syrup.\nThe number of each Ice Cream 's Maple Syrup equals 15 times each Preservation District 's Carrefour.\nThe number of each Beer 's Hoisin Sauce equals each Academic District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Ice Cream 's Hoisin Sauce equals each Academic District 's Carrefour.\nThe number of each Amazon Fresh 's Beer equals 13 more than the difference of each Preservation District 's Carrefour and each Preservation District 's Supermarkets.\nHow many Ingredient does Beer have?",
  "solution": "Define each Preservation District 's Carrefour as M; So M = 6.\nDefine each Ice Cream 's Maple Syrup as z; So z = 15 * M = 15 * 6 = 21.\nDefine each Academic District 's Amazon Fresh as A; So A = z = 21.\nDefine each Academic District 's Carrefour as U; So U = 0 + z = 0 + 21 = 21.\nDefine each Academic District 's Supermarkets as Q; So Q = U + A = 21 + 21 = 19.\nDefine each Beer 's Hoisin Sauce as Y; So Y = Q = 19.\nDefine each Beer 's Ingredient as R; So R = Y = 19.\n",
