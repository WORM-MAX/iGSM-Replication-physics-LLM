  "question": "District category contains Landmark District, Heritage District, and Financial District.\nSupermarkets category contains Lidl, The Fresh Market, and Food Lion.\nProduct category contains Sour Cream, Yogurt Covered Raisins, and Tortillas.\nThe number of each Food Lion 's Tortillas equals 14 more than the sum of each Heritage District 's Supermarkets and each Landmark District 's The Fresh Market.\nThe number of each Landmark District 's Lidl equals the difference of each The Fresh Market 's Sour Cream and each Landmark District 's Food Lion.\nThe number of each Heritage District 's Food Lion equals 18 times the sum of each The Fresh Market 's Sour Cream, each Landmark District 's Food Lion, and each Lidl 's Yogurt Covered Raisins.\nThe number of each Financial District 's Lidl equals 5.\nThe number of each Lidl 's Yogurt Covered Raisins equals 4.\nThe number of each Lidl 's Tortillas equals the sum of each Heritage District 's The Fresh Market and each Landmark District 's The Fresh Market.\nThe number of each Financial District 's Food Lion equals each Heritage District 's The Fresh Market.\nThe number of each Heritage District 's The Fresh Market equals each Landmark District 's The Fresh Market.\nThe number of each Landmark District 's The Fresh Market equals 9.\nThe number of each The Fresh Market 's Yogurt Covered Raisins equals 13.\nThe number of each The Fresh Market 's Tortillas equals 15 more than the sum of each Heritage District 's Supermarkets, each Financial District 's Supermarkets, and each The Fresh Market 's Sour Cream.\nThe number of each Landmark District 's Food Lion equals 3 more than each The Fresh Market 's Sour Cream.\nThe number of each The Fresh Market 's Sour Cream equals 6.\nThe number of each Food Lion 's Yogurt Covered Raisins equals each Heritage District 's Food Lion.\nHow many Tortillas does Lidl have?",
  "solution": "Define each Landmark District 's The Fresh Market as y; So y = 9.\nDefine each Heritage District 's The Fresh Market as a; So a = y = 9.\nDefine each Lidl 's Tortillas as g; So g = a + y = 9 + 9 = 18.\n",
