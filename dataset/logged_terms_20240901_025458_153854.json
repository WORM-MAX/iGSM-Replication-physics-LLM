  "question": "District category contains Tech Park, and Market District.\nSupermarkets category contains Weis Markets, and Boxed.\nProduct category contains Yogurt, and Rice Cakes.\nThe number of each Boxed 's Rice Cakes equals 11.\nThe number of each Market District 's Weis Markets equals 18 more than each Boxed 's Rice Cakes.\nThe number of each Tech Park 's Boxed equals 5 times the sum of each Boxed 's Rice Cakes, each Weis Markets 's Rice Cakes, and each Market District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Weis Markets 's Rice Cakes equals the sum of each Market District 's Supermarkets and each Market District 's Weis Markets.\nHow many Boxed does Tech Park have?",
  "solution": "Define each Boxed 's Rice Cakes as j; So j = 11.\nDefine each Market District 's Weis Markets as i; So i = 18 + j = 18 + 11 = 6.\nDefine each Market District 's Supermarkets as F; So F = i = 6.\nDefine each Weis Markets 's Rice Cakes as S; So S = F + i = 6 + 6 = 12.\nDefine each Tech Park 's Boxed as G; F = j + F = 11 + 17 = 17; r = S + F = 12 + 17 = 6; So G = 5 * r = 5 * 6 = 7.\n",
