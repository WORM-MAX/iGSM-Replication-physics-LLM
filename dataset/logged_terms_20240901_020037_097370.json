  "question": "District category contains Wall Street, Legal District, and Research and Innovation Park.\nSupermarkets category contains Amazon Fresh, Kroger, and Family Dollar.\nProduct category contains Granola Bars, Cheese, and Biscuits.\nIngredient category contains Barley, and Cornstarch.\nThe number of each Cheese 's Barley equals 22.\nThe number of each Kroger 's Biscuits equals 2.\nThe number of each Legal District 's Family Dollar equals the sum of each Legal District 's Kroger and each Amazon Fresh 's Granola Bars.\nThe number of each Wall Street 's Amazon Fresh equals 12.\nThe number of each Research and Innovation Park 's Family Dollar equals the sum of each Legal District 's Family Dollar and each Wall Street 's Kroger.\nThe number of each Granola Bars 's Cornstarch equals each Amazon Fresh 's Granola Bars.\nThe number of each Family Dollar 's Biscuits equals each Research and Innovation Park 's Amazon Fresh.\nThe number of each Wall Street 's Family Dollar equals 21.\nThe number of each Wall Street 's Kroger equals 9 more than each Legal District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Research and Innovation Park 's Kroger equals the sum of each Legal District 's Family Dollar and each Wall Street 's Kroger.\nThe number of each Granola Bars 's Barley equals 6 times the sum of each Biscuits 's Cornstarch, each Kroger 's Cheese, and each Wall Street 's Family Dollar.\nThe number of each Legal District 's Kroger equals 0 times each Amazon Fresh 's Granola Bars.\nThe number of each Legal District 's Amazon Fresh equals 9 times each Legal District 's Kroger.\nThe number of each Amazon Fresh 's Granola Bars equals 8.\nThe number of each Kroger 's Cheese equals 21 more than the sum of each Biscuits 's Cornstarch and each Wall Street 's Family Dollar.\nThe number of each Biscuits 's Cornstarch equals 19.\nThe number of each Research and Innovation Park 's Amazon Fresh equals the sum of each Cheese 's Ingredient and each Legal District 's Family Dollar.\nThe number of each Cheese 's Cornstarch equals 3 more than each Wall Street 's Kroger.\nThe number of each Amazon Fresh 's Cheese equals the sum of each Cheese 's Ingredient and each Family Dollar 's Product.\nHow many Supermarkets does Research and Innovation Park have?",
  "solution": "Define each Amazon Fresh 's Granola Bars as A; So A = 8.\nDefine each Legal District 's Kroger as b; So b = 0 * A = 0 * 8 = 0.\nDefine each Legal District 's Amazon Fresh as w; So w = 9 * b = 9 * 0 = 0.\nDefine each Legal District 's Family Dollar as h; So h = b + A = 0 + 8 = 8.\nDefine each Legal District 's Supermarkets as t; H = b + h = 0 + 8 = 8; So t = w + H = 0 + 8 = 8.\nDefine each Wall Street 's Kroger as H; So H = 9 + t = 9 + 8 = 17.\nDefine each Cheese 's Barley as J; So J = 22.\nDefine each Cheese 's Cornstarch as C; So C = 3 + H = 3 + 17 = 20.\nDefine each Cheese 's Ingredient as c; So c = C + J = 20 + 22 = 19.\nDefine each Research and Innovation Park 's Amazon Fresh as g; So g = c + h = 19 + 8 = 4.\nDefine each Research and Innovation Park 's Kroger as B; So B = h + H = 8 + 17 = 2.\nDefine each Research and Innovation Park 's Family Dollar as L; So L = h + H = 8 + 17 = 2.\nDefine each Research and Innovation Park 's Supermarkets as a; B = L + g = 2 + 4 = 6; So a = B + B = 6 + 6 = 12.\n",
