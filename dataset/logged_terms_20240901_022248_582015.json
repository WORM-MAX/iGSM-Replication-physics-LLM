  "question": "District category contains Landmark District, Dormitory District, and Cultural Heritage Site.\nSupermarkets category contains Sam's Club, Hannaford, and Kroger.\nProduct category contains Evaporated Milk, Energy Drinks, and Cocktail Mixers.\nThe number of each Kroger 's Evaporated Milk equals 10 times the sum of each Dormitory District 's Kroger and each Dormitory District 's Hannaford.\nThe number of each Dormitory District 's Hannaford equals 15.\nThe number of each Cultural Heritage Site 's Hannaford equals 12 more than the sum of each Landmark District 's Sam's Club and each Cultural Heritage Site 's Kroger.\nThe number of each Hannaford 's Evaporated Milk equals 16 more than the sum of each Dormitory District 's Hannaford, each Landmark District 's Sam's Club, and each Kroger 's Evaporated Milk.\nThe number of each Landmark District 's Kroger equals each Landmark District 's Sam's Club.\nThe number of each Dormitory District 's Kroger equals 2 more than each Dormitory District 's Hannaford.\nThe number of each Hannaford 's Energy Drinks equals 14.\nThe number of each Sam's Club 's Evaporated Milk equals 12 times the sum of each Dormitory District 's Hannaford, each Kroger 's Evaporated Milk, and each Dormitory District 's Kroger.\nThe number of each Hannaford 's Cocktail Mixers equals each Sam's Club 's Energy Drinks.\nThe number of each Cultural Heritage Site 's Sam's Club equals the sum of each Sam's Club 's Product, each Dormitory District 's Kroger, each Sam's Club 's Evaporated Milk, and each Dormitory District 's Hannaford.\nThe number of each Sam's Club 's Energy Drinks equals the difference of each Sam's Club 's Evaporated Milk and each Sam's Club 's Cocktail Mixers.\nThe number of each Cultural Heritage Site 's Kroger equals 14 times each Landmark District 's Sam's Club.\nThe number of each Landmark District 's Hannaford equals 3.\nThe number of each Dormitory District 's Sam's Club equals 17.\nThe number of each Landmark District 's Sam's Club equals 21.\nThe number of each Sam's Club 's Cocktail Mixers equals the sum of each Dormitory District 's Hannaford, each Kroger 's Evaporated Milk, and each Dormitory District 's Kroger.\nThe number of each Kroger 's Energy Drinks equals the sum of each Cultural Heritage Site 's Kroger, each Landmark District 's Sam's Club, and each Cultural Heritage Site 's Hannaford.\nHow many Sam's Club does Cultural Heritage Site have?",
  "solution": "Define each Dormitory District 's Hannaford as h; So h = 15.\nDefine each Dormitory District 's Kroger as U; So U = 2 + h = 2 + 15 = 17.\nDefine each Kroger 's Evaporated Milk as k; J = U + h = 17 + 15 = 9; So k = 10 * J = 10 * 9 = 21.\nDefine each Sam's Club 's Evaporated Milk as P; k = k + U = 15 + 17 = 15; E = h + k = 15 + 15 = 7; So P = 12 * E = 12 * 7 = 15.\nDefine each Sam's Club 's Cocktail Mixers as H; g = h + U = 15 + 17 = 9; So H = k + g = 15 + 9 = 1.\nDefine each Sam's Club 's Energy Drinks as o; So o = P - H = 15 - 1 = 14.\nDefine each Sam's Club 's Product as S; e = o + H = 14 + 1 = 15; So S = P + e = 15 + 15 = 7.\nDefine each Cultural Heritage Site 's Sam's Club as Q; M = h + U = 15 + 17 = 9; K = M + P = 9 + 15 = 1; So Q = S + K = 7 + 1 = 8.\n",
