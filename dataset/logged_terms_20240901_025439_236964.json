  "question": "District category contains Suburban Neighborhood, Market District, and Courthouse District.\nSupermarkets category contains SuperValu, Fry's, and Tesco.\nThe number of each Market District 's SuperValu equals 21 more than the sum of each Courthouse District 's SuperValu, each Courthouse District 's Fry's, and each Suburban Neighborhood 's Tesco.\nThe number of each Courthouse District 's Fry's equals each Suburban Neighborhood 's Tesco.\nThe number of each Market District 's Fry's equals each Market District 's Tesco.\nThe number of each Suburban Neighborhood 's Fry's equals 4.\nThe number of each Suburban Neighborhood 's Tesco equals 15 times each Courthouse District 's SuperValu.\nThe number of each Market District 's Tesco equals 13 times the sum of each Suburban Neighborhood 's SuperValu and each Suburban Neighborhood 's Fry's.\nThe number of each Courthouse District 's SuperValu equals 2.\nThe number of each Courthouse District 's Tesco equals the difference of each Suburban Neighborhood 's SuperValu and each Market District 's Tesco.\nThe number of each Suburban Neighborhood 's SuperValu equals 6 more than each Suburban Neighborhood 's Fry's.\nHow many Fry's does Market District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Suburban Neighborhood 's Fry's as b; So b = 4.\nDefine each Suburban Neighborhood 's SuperValu as x; So x = 6 + b = 6 + 4 = 10.\nDefine each Market District 's Tesco as W; b = x + b = 10 + 14 = 14; So W = 13 * b = 13 * 14 = 21.\nDefine each Market District 's Fry's as z; So z = W = 21.\n",
