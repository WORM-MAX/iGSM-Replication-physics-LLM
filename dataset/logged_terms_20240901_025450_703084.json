  "question": "District category contains Urban Residential Area, Administrative District, Legal District, and College Town.\nSupermarkets category contains Fresh Thyme Market, Stop & Shop, 99 Cents Only Stores, and Family Dollar.\nThe number of each Urban Residential Area 's 99 Cents Only Stores equals 14.\nThe number of each Urban Residential Area 's Fresh Thyme Market equals 2 times each Urban Residential Area 's 99 Cents Only Stores.\nThe number of each College Town 's Stop & Shop equals 15 more than each Administrative District 's Fresh Thyme Market.\nThe number of each Administrative District 's Fresh Thyme Market equals 15.\nThe number of each Administrative District 's Family Dollar equals 21.\nThe number of each Legal District 's Stop & Shop equals 18 more than the sum of each Urban Residential Area 's Supermarkets and each College Town 's Supermarkets.\nHow many Supermarkets does Urban Residential Area have?",
  "solution": "Define each Urban Residential Area 's 99 Cents Only Stores as W; So W = 14.\nDefine each Urban Residential Area 's Fresh Thyme Market as F; So F = 2 * W = 2 * 14 = 5.\nDefine each Urban Residential Area 's Supermarkets as G; So G = W + F = 14 + 5 = 19.\n",
