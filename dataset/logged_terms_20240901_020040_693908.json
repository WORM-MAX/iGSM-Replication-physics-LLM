  "question": "District category contains Dormitory District, Cultural Heritage Site, and Arts District.\nSupermarkets category contains Stop & Shop, and Sainsbury's.\nProduct category contains Kefir, Canned Corn, and Yogurt.\nIngredient category contains Evaporated Milk, Pepper, and Thyme.\nThe number of each Canned Corn 's Evaporated Milk equals 16.\nThe number of each Canned Corn 's Pepper equals 21 more than each Sainsbury's 's Product.\nThe number of each Sainsbury's 's Canned Corn equals 10 more than each Kefir 's Pepper.\nThe number of each Cultural Heritage Site 's Stop & Shop equals 16.\nThe number of each Yogurt 's Evaporated Milk equals each Arts District 's Sainsbury's.\nThe number of each Yogurt 's Thyme equals 0.\nThe number of each Dormitory District 's Sainsbury's equals 7.\nThe number of each Kefir 's Pepper equals 0 more than each Dormitory District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Arts District 's Sainsbury's equals the sum of each Dormitory District 's Sainsbury's, each Sainsbury's 's Canned Corn, and each Kefir 's Pepper.\nThe number of each Sainsbury's 's Yogurt equals the sum of each Dormitory District 's Sainsbury's and each Sainsbury's 's Canned Corn.\nThe number of each Stop & Shop 's Yogurt equals the difference of each Cultural Heritage Site 's Stop & Shop and each Canned Corn 's Evaporated Milk.\nHow many Evaporated Milk does Yogurt have?",
  "solution": "Define each Dormitory District 's Sainsbury's as i; So i = 7.\nDefine each Dormitory District 's Supermarkets as A; So A = i = 7.\nDefine each Kefir 's Pepper as o; So o = 0 + A = 0 + 7 = 7.\nDefine each Sainsbury's 's Canned Corn as L; So L = 10 + o = 10 + 7 = 17.\nDefine each Arts District 's Sainsbury's as n; B = i + o = 7 + 7 = 14; So n = L + B = 17 + 14 = 8.\nDefine each Yogurt 's Evaporated Milk as r; So r = n = 8.\n",
