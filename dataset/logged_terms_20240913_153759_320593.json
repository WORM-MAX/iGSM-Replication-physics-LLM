  "question": "Background: There are 2 types of District: Ancient City, and Automotive District.\nThere are 2 types of Supermarkets: Aldi (Germany), and Giant Eagle.\nThere are 2 types of Product: Canned Tomatoes, and Brownies.\nThere are 2 types of Ingredient: Buckwheat, and Spelt.\nEach Ancient City has Giant Eagle and Aldi (Germany).\nEach Automotive District has Aldi (Germany) and Giant Eagle.\nEach Aldi (Germany) has Canned Tomatoes and Brownies.\nEach Giant Eagle has Brownies and Canned Tomatoes.\nEach Canned Tomatoes has Spelt and Buckwheat.\nEach Brownies has Spelt and Buckwheat.\nThe number of each Canned Tomatoes 's Buckwheat equals 0 more than each Brownies 's Ingredient.\nThe number of each Giant Eagle 's Brownies equals each Ancient City 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Aldi (Germany) 's Canned Tomatoes equals 11.\nThe number of each Automotive District 's Aldi (Germany) equals the difference of each Aldi (Germany) 's Ingredient and each Aldi (Germany) 's Canned Tomatoes.\nThe number of each Ancient City 's Aldi (Germany) equals 6 times each Giant Eagle 's Canned Tomatoes.\nThe number of each Automotive District 's Giant Eagle equals 6.\nThe number of each Ancient City 's Giant Eagle equals 16 more than the difference of each Ancient City 's Aldi (Germany) and each Giant Eagle 's Canned Tomatoes.\nThe number of each Aldi (Germany) 's Brownies equals 6 more than each Brownies 's Spelt.\nThe number of each Giant Eagle 's Canned Tomatoes equals 7.\nThe number of each Brownies 's Buckwheat equals 15 more than each Automotive District 's Giant Eagle.\nThe number of each Canned Tomatoes 's Spelt equals 14 more than each Giant Eagle 's Brownies.\nThe number of each Brownies 's Spelt equals 16 times each Automotive District 's Giant Eagle.\nHow many Aldi (Germany) does Automotive District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Giant Eagle 's Canned Tomatoes as W; So W = 7.\nDefine each Ancient City 's Aldi (Germany) as x; So x = 6 * W = 6 * 7 = 19.\nDefine each Ancient City 's Giant Eagle as U; I = x - W = 19 - 7 = 12; So U = 16 + I = 16 + 12 = 5.\nDefine each Ancient City 's Supermarkets as y; So y = x + U = 19 + 5 = 1.\nDefine each Giant Eagle 's Brownies as F; So F = y = 1.\nDefine each Automotive District 's Giant Eagle as E; So E = 6.\nDefine each Brownies 's Buckwheat as D; So D = 15 + E = 15 + 6 = 21.\nDefine each Brownies 's Spelt as k; So k = 16 * E = 16 * 6 = 4.\nDefine each Aldi (Germany) 's Brownies as S; So S = 6 + k = 6 + 4 = 10.\nDefine each Aldi (Germany) 's Canned Tomatoes as s; So s = 11.\nDefine each Brownies 's Ingredient as R; So R = k + D = 4 + 21 = 2.\nDefine each Canned Tomatoes 's Buckwheat as b; So b = 0 + R = 0 + 2 = 2.\nDefine each Canned Tomatoes 's Spelt as i; So i = 14 + F = 14 + 1 = 15.\nDefine each Canned Tomatoes 's Ingredient as I; So I = i + b = 15 + 2 = 17.\nDefine each Aldi (Germany) 's Ingredient as V; N = S * s = 10 * 11 = 18; L = I * R = 17 * 2 = 11; So V = N + L = 18 + 11 = 6.\nDefine each Automotive District 's Aldi (Germany) as L; So L = V - s = 6 - 11 = 18.\n",
