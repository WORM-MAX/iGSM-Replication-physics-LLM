  "question": "District category contains Arts District, and School District.\nSupermarkets category contains Trader Joe's, and Lulu Hypermarket.\nProduct category contains Pies, and Coffee.\nThe number of each Lulu Hypermarket 's Coffee equals 19.\nThe number of each Trader Joe's 's Pies equals 22 times each Lulu Hypermarket 's Product.\nThe number of each School District 's Trader Joe's equals 19 times each School District 's Lulu Hypermarket.\nThe number of each Lulu Hypermarket 's Pies equals each Lulu Hypermarket 's Coffee.\nThe number of each Arts District 's Lulu Hypermarket equals 12 times the sum of each Lulu Hypermarket 's Pies, each Lulu Hypermarket 's Product, and each School District 's Trader Joe's.\nThe number of each School District 's Lulu Hypermarket equals 16 times each Arts District 's Trader Joe's.\nThe number of each Arts District 's Trader Joe's equals 7.\nHow many Product does Trader Joe's have?",
  "solution": "Define each Lulu Hypermarket 's Coffee as X; So X = 19.\nDefine each Lulu Hypermarket 's Pies as x; So x = X = 19.\nDefine each Lulu Hypermarket 's Product as B; So B = X + x = 19 + 19 = 15.\nDefine each Trader Joe's 's Pies as Q; So Q = 22 * B = 22 * 15 = 8.\nDefine each Trader Joe's 's Product as V; So V = Q = 8.\n",
