  "question": "District category contains High-rise Apartment Complex, Academic District, and Landmark District.\nSupermarkets category contains Peapod, Vons, Metro (Canada), and Grocery Outlet.\nProduct category contains Trail Mix, Yogurt, Sports Drinks, and Canned Peaches.\nThe number of each Academic District 's Vons equals the difference of each Peapod 's Product and each Vons 's Yogurt.\nThe number of each Metro (Canada) 's Yogurt equals 10.\nThe number of each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Peapod equals the difference of each Peapod 's Product and each Landmark District 's Peapod.\nThe number of each Peapod 's Yogurt equals 3.\nThe number of each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Metro (Canada) equals 13 times each Landmark District 's Product.\nThe number of each Vons 's Yogurt equals each Grocery Outlet 's Yogurt.\nThe number of each Grocery Outlet 's Yogurt equals 13.\nThe number of each Landmark District 's Peapod equals each Peapod 's Yogurt.\nHow many Supermarkets does High-rise Apartment Complex have?",
  "solution": "Define each Peapod 's Yogurt as u; So u = 3.\nDefine each Landmark District 's Peapod as J; So J = u = 3.\nDefine each Peapod 's Product as h; So h = u = 3.\nDefine each Landmark District 's Product as P; P = h * J = 3 * 3 = 9.\nDefine each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Metro (Canada) as g; So g = 13 * P = 13 * 9 = 2.\nDefine each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Peapod as S; So S = h - J = 3 - 3 = 0.\nDefine each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Supermarkets as v; So v = S + g = 0 + 2 = 2.\n",
