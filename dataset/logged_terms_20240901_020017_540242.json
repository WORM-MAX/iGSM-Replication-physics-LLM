  "question": "District category contains Learning Hub, Market District, and High School Zone.\nSupermarkets category contains Aldi, Lidl, and Publix.\nThe number of each High School Zone 's Publix equals 14 times the sum of each Market District 's Aldi, each Learning Hub 's Aldi, and each High School Zone 's Lidl.\nThe number of each High School Zone 's Aldi equals 0 more than the sum of each Market District 's Lidl and each Market District 's Publix.\nThe number of each High School Zone 's Lidl equals the sum of each Market District 's Aldi, each Learning Hub 's Aldi, and each Market District 's Publix.\nThe number of each Learning Hub 's Lidl equals 2.\nThe number of each Market District 's Aldi equals 15 more than each Market District 's Publix.\nThe number of each Market District 's Publix equals 9 times each Learning Hub 's Aldi.\nThe number of each Market District 's Lidl equals 1 more than the sum of each High School Zone 's Lidl, each Market District 's Publix, and each Market District 's Aldi.\nThe number of each Learning Hub 's Aldi equals 11.\nThe number of each Learning Hub 's Publix equals each Market District 's Lidl.\nHow many Lidl does High School Zone have?",
  "solution": "Define each Learning Hub 's Aldi as m; So m = 11.\nDefine each Market District 's Publix as r; So r = 9 * m = 9 * 11 = 7.\nDefine each Market District 's Aldi as P; So P = 15 + r = 15 + 7 = 22.\nDefine each High School Zone 's Lidl as z; s = m + r = 11 + 7 = 18; So z = P + s = 22 + 18 = 17.\n",
