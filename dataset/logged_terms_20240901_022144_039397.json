  "question": "District category contains Shopping District, Automotive District, and Industrial District.\nSupermarkets category contains Fairway Market, Family Dollar, and Save-A-Lot.\nThe number of each Shopping District 's Family Dollar equals the sum of each Industrial District 's Save-A-Lot, each Industrial District 's Supermarkets, each Automotive District 's Supermarkets, and each Automotive District 's Save-A-Lot.\nThe number of each Industrial District 's Save-A-Lot equals 16.\nThe number of each Automotive District 's Save-A-Lot equals 8 times the difference of each Industrial District 's Supermarkets and each Industrial District 's Save-A-Lot.\nHow many Supermarkets does Shopping District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Industrial District 's Save-A-Lot as P; So P = 16.\nDefine each Industrial District 's Supermarkets as v; So v = P = 16.\nDefine each Automotive District 's Save-A-Lot as k; v = v - P = 0 - 16 = 0; So k = 8 * v = 8 * 0 = 0.\nDefine each Automotive District 's Supermarkets as B; So B = k = 0.\nDefine each Shopping District 's Family Dollar as Y; I = P + v = 16 + 0 = 16; z = I + k = 16 + 0 = 16; So Y = B + z = 0 + 16 = 16.\nDefine each Shopping District 's Supermarkets as p; So p = Y = 16.\n",
