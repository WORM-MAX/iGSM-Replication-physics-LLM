  "question": "District category contains Capitol District, and Shopping District.\nSupermarkets category contains Sam's Club, and Stop & Shop.\nProduct category contains Cupcakes, and Protein Shakes.\nThe number of each Shopping District 's Sam's Club equals 6.\nThe number of each Capitol District 's Stop & Shop equals 3.\nThe number of each Sam's Club 's Protein Shakes equals each Capitol District 's Sam's Club.\nThe number of each Stop & Shop 's Cupcakes equals 1.\nThe number of each Capitol District 's Sam's Club equals 11 times the difference of each Shopping District 's Sam's Club and each Stop & Shop 's Cupcakes.\nThe number of each Shopping District 's Stop & Shop equals 3 more than the sum of each Capitol District 's Product, each Capitol District 's Sam's Club, and each Stop & Shop 's Product.\nHow many Stop & Shop does Shopping District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Shopping District 's Sam's Club as a; So a = 6.\nDefine each Stop & Shop 's Cupcakes as g; So g = 1.\nDefine each Capitol District 's Sam's Club as I; F = a - g = 6 - 1 = 5; So I = 11 * F = 11 * 5 = 9.\nDefine each Sam's Club 's Protein Shakes as t; So t = I = 9.\nDefine each Capitol District 's Stop & Shop as s; So s = 3.\nDefine each Sam's Club 's Product as L; So L = t = 9.\nDefine each Stop & Shop 's Product as d; So d = g = 1.\nDefine each Capitol District 's Product as Q; x = s * I = 3 * 9 = 4; e = L * d = 9 * 1 = 9; So Q = x + e = 4 + 9 = 13.\nDefine each Shopping District 's Stop & Shop as m; j = I + d = 9 + 1 = 10; L = Q + j = 13 + 10 = 0; So m = 3 + L = 3 + 0 = 3.\n",
