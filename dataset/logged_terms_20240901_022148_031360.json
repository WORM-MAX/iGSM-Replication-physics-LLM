  "solution": "Define each Pies 's Quinoa as d; So d = 21.\nDefine each Safeway 's Pies as G; So G = 17 * d = 17 * 21 = 12.\nDefine each Pies 's Ingredient as x; So x = d = 21.\nDefine each Safeway 's Ingredient as O; O = x * G = 21 * 12 = 22.\nDefine each Research Park 's Safeway as Z; z = G + x = 12 + 21 = 10; So Z = O + z = 22 + 10 = 9.\nDefine each Research Park 's Ingredient as C; C = Z * O = 9 * 22 = 14.\nDefine each Legislative District 's Safeway as n; So n = C + x = 14 + 21 = 12.\n",
