  "question": "District category contains Capitol District, Shopping District, Municipal Office District, and School District.\nSupermarkets category contains Safeway, Metro (Canada), SuperValu, and The Fresh Market.\nProduct category contains Bottled Water, Nuts, Soda, and Whipped Cream.\nIngredient category contains Oregano, Molasses, Coconut Oil, and Nuts.\nThe number of each Safeway 's Nuts equals 0.\nThe number of each Shopping District 's Metro (Canada) equals 1 times each School District 's The Fresh Market.\nThe number of each Metro (Canada) 's Soda equals 6 more than each Soda 's Ingredient.\nThe number of each Municipal Office District 's Metro (Canada) equals 12.\nThe number of each SuperValu 's Soda equals 6 more than the sum of each The Fresh Market 's Product, each Nuts 's Oregano, and each Bottled Water 's Ingredient.\nThe number of each Soda 's Molasses equals 11 more than each Shopping District 's Metro (Canada).\nThe number of each Nuts 's Oregano equals 16 times each Soda 's Molasses.\nThe number of each Capitol District 's Safeway equals 7.\nThe number of each Bottled Water 's Molasses equals 0 more than each Nuts 's Oregano.\nThe number of each The Fresh Market 's Bottled Water equals each Municipal Office District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each School District 's The Fresh Market equals 6 more than each Capitol District 's Safeway.\nThe number of each Whipped Cream 's Molasses equals 18 more than the sum of each Municipal Office District 's Metro (Canada) and each Safeway 's Nuts.\nHow many Molasses does Bottled Water have?",
  "solution": "Define each Capitol District 's Safeway as y; So y = 7.\nDefine each School District 's The Fresh Market as V; So V = 6 + y = 6 + 7 = 13.\nDefine each Shopping District 's Metro (Canada) as v; So v = 1 * V = 1 * 13 = 13.\nDefine each Soda 's Molasses as d; So d = 11 + v = 11 + 13 = 1.\nDefine each Nuts 's Oregano as w; So w = 16 * d = 16 * 1 = 16.\nDefine each Bottled Water 's Molasses as m; So m = 0 + w = 0 + 16 = 16.\n",
