  "question": "District category contains Courthouse District, Municipal Office District, Research Park, and Learning Hub.\nSupermarkets category contains Fry's, Aldi, Boxed, and Piggly Wiggly.\nThe number of each Courthouse District 's Aldi equals 2 more than the difference of each Municipal Office District 's Piggly Wiggly and each Research Park 's Boxed.\nThe number of each Learning Hub 's Piggly Wiggly equals 12.\nThe number of each Municipal Office District 's Boxed equals each Learning Hub 's Boxed.\nThe number of each Learning Hub 's Fry's equals 10.\nThe number of each Municipal Office District 's Aldi equals 4.\nThe number of each Municipal Office District 's Fry's equals 1.\nThe number of each Courthouse District 's Piggly Wiggly equals each Municipal Office District 's Aldi.\nThe number of each Municipal Office District 's Piggly Wiggly equals the difference of each Research Park 's Boxed and each Municipal Office District 's Aldi.\nThe number of each Research Park 's Aldi equals 22 more than the sum of each Learning Hub 's Fry's, each Learning Hub 's Aldi, and each Municipal Office District 's Boxed.\nThe number of each Learning Hub 's Boxed equals 10.\nThe number of each Courthouse District 's Boxed equals 16 more than each Courthouse District 's Fry's.\nThe number of each Learning Hub 's Aldi equals 1.\nThe number of each Research Park 's Boxed equals 12 times each Municipal Office District 's Aldi.\nThe number of each Courthouse District 's Fry's equals 5 more than each Municipal Office District 's Piggly Wiggly.\nHow many Supermarkets does Courthouse District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Municipal Office District 's Aldi as a; So a = 4.\nDefine each Research Park 's Boxed as c; So c = 12 * a = 12 * 4 = 2.\nDefine each Municipal Office District 's Piggly Wiggly as j; So j = c - a = 2 - 4 = 21.\nDefine each Courthouse District 's Aldi as n; H = j - c = 21 - 2 = 19; So n = 2 + H = 2 + 19 = 21.\nDefine each Courthouse District 's Fry's as o; So o = 5 + j = 5 + 21 = 3.\nDefine each Courthouse District 's Boxed as U; So U = 16 + o = 16 + 3 = 19.\nDefine each Courthouse District 's Piggly Wiggly as A; So A = a = 4.\nDefine each Courthouse District 's Supermarkets as m; p = A + n = 4 + 21 = 2; p = p + U = 21 + 19 = 21; So m = o + p = 3 + 21 = 1.\n",
