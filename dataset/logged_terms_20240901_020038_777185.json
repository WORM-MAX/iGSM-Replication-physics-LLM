  "question": "District category contains Research and Innovation Park, Wall Street, and School District.\nSupermarkets category contains WinCo Foods, Family Dollar, and Morrisons.\nProduct category contains Plant-based Cheese, Canned Peas, and Pretzels.\nThe number of each Family Dollar 's Plant-based Cheese equals each Research and Innovation Park 's Family Dollar.\nThe number of each Morrisons 's Canned Peas equals 5 times the sum of each School District 's Supermarkets, each Research and Innovation Park 's Product, and each Wall Street 's WinCo Foods.\nThe number of each Research and Innovation Park 's Family Dollar equals 12.\nThe number of each WinCo Foods 's Pretzels equals the sum of each Family Dollar 's Product, each Research and Innovation Park 's Family Dollar, each Family Dollar 's Plant-based Cheese, and each Wall Street 's WinCo Foods.\nThe number of each School District 's Family Dollar equals 15.\nThe number of each Wall Street 's WinCo Foods equals each Research and Innovation Park 's Product.\nHow many Product does Wall Street have?",
  "solution": "Define each Research and Innovation Park 's Family Dollar as a; So a = 12.\nDefine each Family Dollar 's Plant-based Cheese as u; So u = a = 12.\nDefine each Family Dollar 's Product as W; So W = u = 12.\nDefine each Research and Innovation Park 's Product as z; z = W * a = 12 * 12 = 6.\nDefine each Wall Street 's WinCo Foods as C; So C = z = 6.\nDefine each WinCo Foods 's Pretzels as J; U = u + W = 12 + 12 = 1; d = U + a = 1 + 12 = 13; So J = C + d = 6 + 13 = 19.\nDefine each WinCo Foods 's Product as O; So O = J = 19.\nDefine each Wall Street 's Product as k; k = C * O = 6 * 19 = 22.\n",
