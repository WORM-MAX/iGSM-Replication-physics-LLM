  "question": "District category contains Industrial District, and Dormitory District.\nSupermarkets category contains Fairway Market, and Bristol Farms.\nProduct category contains Canned Vegetables, and Bagels.\nThe number of each Dormitory District 's Fairway Market equals each Bristol Farms 's Canned Vegetables.\nThe number of each Fairway Market 's Bagels equals each Fairway Market 's Canned Vegetables.\nThe number of each Bristol Farms 's Canned Vegetables equals 19.\nThe number of each Industrial District 's Fairway Market equals 10 more than each Industrial District 's Bristol Farms.\nThe number of each Fairway Market 's Canned Vegetables equals 22.\nThe number of each Industrial District 's Bristol Farms equals 10.\nHow many Product does Fairway Market have?",
  "solution": "Define each Fairway Market 's Canned Vegetables as v; So v = 22.\nDefine each Fairway Market 's Bagels as b; So b = v = 22.\nDefine each Fairway Market 's Product as L; So L = b + v = 22 + 22 = 21.\n",
