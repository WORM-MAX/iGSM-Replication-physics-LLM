  "solution": "Define each Walmart 's Rice Cakes as o; So o = 10.\nDefine each Entertainment District 's Mitsuwa Marketplace as B; So B = 22 + o = 22 + 10 = 9.\nDefine each Entertainment District 's PriceRite as h; So h = 20 + B = 20 + 9 = 6.\nDefine each Government Complex 's PriceRite as a; So a = 14 * h = 14 * 6 = 15.\nDefine each Government Complex 's Supermarkets as r; So r = a = 15.\nDefine each PriceRite 's Canned Broth as J; So J = 14 + r = 14 + 15 = 6.\n",
