  "question": "District category contains Administrative District, Research and Innovation Park, Media District, and Entertainment District.\nSupermarkets category contains King Soopers, Big Lots, Food Lion, and Hannaford.\nThe number of each Administrative District 's Hannaford equals the difference of each Media District 's King Soopers and each Administrative District 's Food Lion.\nThe number of each Entertainment District 's King Soopers equals 8.\nThe number of each Media District 's Food Lion equals 17 times the sum of each Research and Innovation Park 's Supermarkets and each Research and Innovation Park 's Big Lots.\nThe number of each Media District 's King Soopers equals each Administrative District 's Food Lion.\nThe number of each Administrative District 's Food Lion equals 2.\nThe number of each Research and Innovation Park 's King Soopers equals the sum of each Administrative District 's Hannaford, each Administrative District 's Food Lion, and each Research and Innovation Park 's Big Lots.\nThe number of each Administrative District 's Big Lots equals each Media District 's Food Lion.\nThe number of each Research and Innovation Park 's Big Lots equals 9 more than each Administrative District 's Hannaford.\nThe number of each Entertainment District 's Food Lion equals 18 times the sum of each Research and Innovation Park 's King Soopers, each Research and Innovation Park 's Big Lots, and each Administrative District 's Hannaford.\nHow many Big Lots does Administrative District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Administrative District 's Food Lion as B; So B = 2.\nDefine each Media District 's King Soopers as c; So c = B = 2.\nDefine each Administrative District 's Hannaford as O; So O = c - B = 2 - 2 = 0.\nDefine each Research and Innovation Park 's Big Lots as G; So G = 9 + O = 9 + 0 = 9.\nDefine each Research and Innovation Park 's King Soopers as N; s = G + O = 9 + 0 = 9; So N = B + s = 2 + 9 = 11.\nDefine each Research and Innovation Park 's Supermarkets as E; So E = G + N = 9 + 11 = 20.\nDefine each Media District 's Food Lion as X; q = E + G = 20 + 9 = 6; So X = 17 * q = 17 * 6 = 10.\nDefine each Administrative District 's Big Lots as M; So M = X = 10.\n",
