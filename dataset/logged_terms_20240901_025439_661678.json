  "question": "District category contains Arts District, Tech Park, Capitol District, and Preservation District.\nSupermarkets category contains Kroger, Eataly, Shipt, and Misfits Market.\nThe number of each Capitol District 's Eataly equals 9 more than the sum of each Preservation District 's Misfits Market and each Tech Park 's Shipt.\nThe number of each Tech Park 's Kroger equals each Arts District 's Kroger.\nThe number of each Arts District 's Misfits Market equals 19.\nThe number of each Tech Park 's Eataly equals each Capitol District 's Shipt.\nThe number of each Arts District 's Eataly equals the sum of each Preservation District 's Shipt, each Capitol District 's Supermarkets, and each Arts District 's Shipt.\nThe number of each Preservation District 's Eataly equals each Preservation District 's Misfits Market.\nThe number of each Arts District 's Shipt equals 1.\nThe number of each Arts District 's Kroger equals 11.\nThe number of each Preservation District 's Shipt equals 11 times each Capitol District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Preservation District 's Misfits Market equals 11 more than each Arts District 's Shipt.\nThe number of each Tech Park 's Misfits Market equals 12 more than the sum of each Preservation District 's Shipt, each Arts District 's Kroger, and each Capitol District 's Eataly.\nThe number of each Capitol District 's Shipt equals 20 times the sum of each Arts District 's Shipt, each Preservation District 's Eataly, and each Tech Park 's Shipt.\nThe number of each Tech Park 's Shipt equals each Preservation District 's Eataly.\nThe number of each Preservation District 's Kroger equals each Arts District 's Kroger.\nHow many Eataly does Arts District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Arts District 's Shipt as R; So R = 1.\nDefine each Preservation District 's Misfits Market as U; So U = 11 + R = 11 + 1 = 12.\nDefine each Preservation District 's Eataly as f; So f = U = 12.\nDefine each Tech Park 's Shipt as g; So g = f = 12.\nDefine each Capitol District 's Shipt as O; h = f + R = 12 + 1 = 13; z = g + h = 12 + 13 = 2; So O = 20 * z = 20 * 2 = 17.\nDefine each Capitol District 's Eataly as r; y = U + g = 12 + 12 = 1; So r = 9 + y = 9 + 1 = 10.\nDefine each Capitol District 's Supermarkets as D; So D = r + O = 10 + 17 = 4.\nDefine each Preservation District 's Shipt as e; So e = 11 * D = 11 * 4 = 21.\nDefine each Arts District 's Eataly as c; l = D + R = 4 + 1 = 5; So c = e + l = 21 + 5 = 3.\n",
