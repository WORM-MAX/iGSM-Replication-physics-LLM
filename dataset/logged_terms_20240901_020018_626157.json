  "question": "District category contains High School Zone, Heritage District, and University Campus.\nSupermarkets category contains Walmart, Giant Eagle, and WinCo Foods.\nThe number of each University Campus 's Giant Eagle equals 19.\nThe number of each University Campus 's Walmart equals each High School Zone 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each University Campus 's WinCo Foods equals the sum of each Heritage District 's WinCo Foods, each High School Zone 's Giant Eagle, each Heritage District 's Walmart, and each High School Zone 's WinCo Foods.\nThe number of each High School Zone 's WinCo Foods equals 13.\nThe number of each Heritage District 's Walmart equals 19 times each High School Zone 's Giant Eagle.\nThe number of each Heritage District 's Giant Eagle equals the difference of each University Campus 's WinCo Foods and each High School Zone 's Giant Eagle.\nThe number of each High School Zone 's Walmart equals 22.\nThe number of each Heritage District 's WinCo Foods equals the sum of each Heritage District 's Walmart and each High School Zone 's Giant Eagle.\nThe number of each High School Zone 's Giant Eagle equals 19.\nHow many WinCo Foods does Heritage District have?",
  "solution": "Define each High School Zone 's Giant Eagle as m; So m = 19.\nDefine each Heritage District 's Walmart as X; So X = 19 * m = 19 * 19 = 16.\nDefine each Heritage District 's WinCo Foods as C; So C = X + m = 16 + 19 = 12.\n",
