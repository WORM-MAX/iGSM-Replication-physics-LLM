  "solution": "Define each Loblaws 's Flavored Water as v; So v = 21.\nDefine each Flavored Water 's Olive Oil as P; So P = v = 21.\nDefine each Flavored Water 's Ingredient as x; So x = P = 21.\nDefine each Loblaws 's Ingredient as l; l = x * v = 21 * 21 = 4.\nDefine each Stop & Shop 's Nuts as g; So g = l = 4.\nDefine each Stop & Shop 's Product as n; So n = g = 4.\n",
