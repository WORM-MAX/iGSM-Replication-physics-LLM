  "solution": "Define each Silicon Valley 's Trader Joe's as J; So J = 5.\nDefine each Canned Peaches 's Sunflower Oil as E; So E = 11 + J = 11 + 5 = 16.\nDefine each Canned Peaches 's Ghee as r; So r = E = 16.\nDefine each Canned Peaches 's Ingredient as Z; So Z = E + r = 16 + 16 = 9.\nDefine each Canned Fish 's Sunflower Oil as B; f = Z + r = 9 + 16 = 2; So B = 7 + f = 7 + 2 = 9.\nDefine each Canned Fish 's Ghee as A; So A = 18 * r = 18 * 16 = 12.\nDefine each Canned Fish 's Ingredient as i; So i = B + A = 9 + 12 = 21.\n",
