  "question": "District category contains Entertainment District, and Industrial District.\nSupermarkets category contains Sam's Club, and Lulu Hypermarket.\nProduct category contains Hummus, Chocolate Covered Pretzels, Canned Corn, and Canned Meat.\nThe number of each Industrial District 's Sam's Club equals 22 times each Lulu Hypermarket 's Hummus.\nThe number of each Sam's Club 's Canned Corn equals 9.\nThe number of each Lulu Hypermarket 's Hummus equals each Sam's Club 's Canned Corn.\nThe number of each Entertainment District 's Lulu Hypermarket equals the sum of each Sam's Club 's Canned Corn and each Lulu Hypermarket 's Hummus.\nThe number of each Lulu Hypermarket 's Chocolate Covered Pretzels equals the sum of each Sam's Club 's Product, each Lulu Hypermarket 's Hummus, and each Industrial District 's Lulu Hypermarket.\nThe number of each Lulu Hypermarket 's Canned Corn equals 20 more than each Sam's Club 's Canned Corn.\nThe number of each Sam's Club 's Chocolate Covered Pretzels equals 16 times each Sam's Club 's Canned Meat.\nThe number of each Lulu Hypermarket 's Canned Meat equals the sum of each Sam's Club 's Canned Corn, each Industrial District 's Lulu Hypermarket, and each Sam's Club 's Chocolate Covered Pretzels.\nThe number of each Sam's Club 's Canned Meat equals 1 times each Entertainment District 's Sam's Club.\nThe number of each Industrial District 's Lulu Hypermarket equals 5.\nThe number of each Entertainment District 's Sam's Club equals 22 times each Industrial District 's Lulu Hypermarket.\nHow many Chocolate Covered Pretzels does Sam's Club have?",
  "solution": "Define each Industrial District 's Lulu Hypermarket as J; So J = 5.\nDefine each Entertainment District 's Sam's Club as S; So S = 22 * J = 22 * 5 = 18.\nDefine each Sam's Club 's Canned Meat as u; So u = 1 * S = 1 * 18 = 18.\nDefine each Sam's Club 's Chocolate Covered Pretzels as x; So x = 16 * u = 16 * 18 = 12.\n",
