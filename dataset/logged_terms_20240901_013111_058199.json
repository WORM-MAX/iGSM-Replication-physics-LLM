  "question": "District category contains Research and Innovation Park, Financial District, Library District, and Education Park.\nSupermarkets category contains Bristol Farms, Giant Eagle, Gelson's Markets, and Aldi (Germany).\nThe number of each Education Park 's Bristol Farms equals each Education Park 's Aldi (Germany).\nThe number of each Research and Innovation Park 's Bristol Farms equals each Education Park 's Aldi (Germany).\nThe number of each Financial District 's Giant Eagle equals 0 times the sum of each Library District 's Aldi (Germany) and each Library District 's Gelson's Markets.\nThe number of each Library District 's Aldi (Germany) equals 16 times each Library District 's Gelson's Markets.\nThe number of each Library District 's Gelson's Markets equals 7.\nThe number of each Research and Innovation Park 's Aldi (Germany) equals 5.\nThe number of each Education Park 's Aldi (Germany) equals 15.\nThe number of each Library District 's Bristol Farms equals each Financial District 's Giant Eagle.\nHow many Supermarkets does Financial District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Library District 's Gelson's Markets as D; So D = 7.\nDefine each Library District 's Aldi (Germany) as R; So R = 16 * D = 16 * 7 = 20.\nDefine each Financial District 's Giant Eagle as e; K = R + D = 20 + 7 = 4; So e = 0 * K = 0 * 4 = 0.\nDefine each Financial District 's Supermarkets as P; So P = e = 0.\n",
