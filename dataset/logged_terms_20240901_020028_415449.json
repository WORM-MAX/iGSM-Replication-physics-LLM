  "question": "District category contains School District, Urban Residential Area, Ancient City, and Media District.\nSupermarkets category contains Costco, Fresh Thyme Market, Natural Grocers, and Lidl.\nThe number of each School District 's Fresh Thyme Market equals each Media District 's Lidl.\nThe number of each School District 's Natural Grocers equals 5.\nThe number of each Ancient City 's Costco equals 0 more than each School District 's Fresh Thyme Market.\nThe number of each Media District 's Costco equals 1 times each Urban Residential Area 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Urban Residential Area 's Fresh Thyme Market equals 9 more than each Urban Residential Area 's Natural Grocers.\nThe number of each School District 's Costco equals the difference of each School District 's Natural Grocers and each Urban Residential Area 's Natural Grocers.\nThe number of each Media District 's Natural Grocers equals 11 times the sum of each Urban Residential Area 's Supermarkets and each Urban Residential Area 's Fresh Thyme Market.\nThe number of each Ancient City 's Lidl equals 6 times each School District 's Natural Grocers.\nThe number of each Urban Residential Area 's Costco equals the sum of each Media District 's Lidl and each Urban Residential Area 's Natural Grocers.\nThe number of each Media District 's Lidl equals 1.\nThe number of each Urban Residential Area 's Natural Grocers equals 15 times each Media District 's Lidl.\nHow many Supermarkets does Urban Residential Area have?",
  "solution": "Define each Media District 's Lidl as c; So c = 1.\nDefine each Urban Residential Area 's Natural Grocers as j; So j = 15 * c = 15 * 1 = 15.\nDefine each Urban Residential Area 's Fresh Thyme Market as E; So E = 9 + j = 9 + 15 = 1.\nDefine each Urban Residential Area 's Costco as G; So G = c + j = 1 + 15 = 16.\nDefine each Urban Residential Area 's Supermarkets as x; A = E + j = 1 + 15 = 16; So x = G + A = 16 + 16 = 9.\n",
