  "question": "District category contains Urban Residential Area, College Town, and Government Complex.\nSupermarkets category contains Walmart, Kroger, and Blue Apron.\nThe number of each Urban Residential Area 's Blue Apron equals 16.\nThe number of each Government Complex 's Blue Apron equals the sum of each College Town 's Supermarkets, each Urban Residential Area 's Walmart, each Urban Residential Area 's Blue Apron, and each Urban Residential Area 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each College Town 's Kroger equals 16 times each Urban Residential Area 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Urban Residential Area 's Walmart equals 15.\nHow many Supermarkets does Government Complex have?",
  "solution": "Define each Urban Residential Area 's Walmart as H; So H = 15.\nDefine each Urban Residential Area 's Blue Apron as m; So m = 16.\nDefine each Urban Residential Area 's Supermarkets as X; So X = m + H = 16 + 15 = 8.\nDefine each College Town 's Kroger as T; So T = 16 * X = 16 * 8 = 13.\nDefine each College Town 's Supermarkets as D; So D = T = 13.\nDefine each Government Complex 's Blue Apron as N; Q = H + X = 15 + 8 = 0; a = Q + m = 0 + 16 = 16; So N = D + a = 13 + 16 = 6.\nDefine each Government Complex 's Supermarkets as R; So R = N = 6.\n",
