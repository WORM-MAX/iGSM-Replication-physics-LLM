  "question": "District category contains Municipal Office District, and Shopping District.\nSupermarkets category contains Metro (Canada), and Big Lots.\nProduct category contains Canned Pineapple, and Ice Cream.\nIngredient category contains Peanut Butter, and Parsley.\nThe number of each Big Lots 's Canned Pineapple equals 15 more than each Municipal Office District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Metro (Canada) 's Canned Pineapple equals the sum of each Municipal Office District 's Ingredient, each Canned Pineapple 's Ingredient, and each Big Lots 's Ingredient.\nThe number of each Shopping District 's Metro (Canada) equals 14 more than the sum of each Municipal Office District 's Big Lots, each Municipal Office District 's Supermarkets, and each Municipal Office District 's Product.\nThe number of each Canned Pineapple 's Parsley equals 18 times each Municipal Office District 's Product.\nThe number of each Ice Cream 's Parsley equals 9.\nThe number of each Municipal Office District 's Big Lots equals 0.\nHow many Ingredient does Municipal Office District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Municipal Office District 's Big Lots as Q; So Q = 0.\nDefine each Municipal Office District 's Supermarkets as w; So w = Q = 0.\nDefine each Big Lots 's Canned Pineapple as c; So c = 15 + w = 15 + 0 = 15.\nDefine each Big Lots 's Product as s; So s = c = 15.\nDefine each Municipal Office District 's Product as W; W = s * Q = 15 * 0 = 0.\nDefine each Canned Pineapple 's Parsley as E; So E = 18 * W = 18 * 0 = 0.\nDefine each Canned Pineapple 's Ingredient as h; So h = E = 0.\nDefine each Big Lots 's Ingredient as o; o = h * c = 0 * 15 = 0.\nDefine each Municipal Office District 's Ingredient as X; X = o * Q = 0 * 0 = 0.\n",
