  "question": "District category contains Education Park, and Colonial District.\nSupermarkets category contains Giant Eagle, and Costco.\nProduct category contains Muffins, and Tea.\nThe number of each Giant Eagle 's Tea equals 15 more than the sum of each Education Park 's Giant Eagle and each Colonial District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Giant Eagle 's Muffins equals 9 times each Education Park 's Costco.\nThe number of each Costco 's Muffins equals 14.\nThe number of each Education Park 's Giant Eagle equals each Education Park 's Costco.\nThe number of each Costco 's Tea equals the sum of each Colonial District 's Costco, each Costco 's Muffins, and each Colonial District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Colonial District 's Giant Eagle equals 21 times each Giant Eagle 's Muffins.\nThe number of each Education Park 's Costco equals 22.\nThe number of each Colonial District 's Costco equals 21 more than each Giant Eagle 's Muffins.\nHow many Supermarkets does Colonial District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Education Park 's Costco as N; So N = 22.\nDefine each Giant Eagle 's Muffins as P; So P = 9 * N = 9 * 22 = 14.\nDefine each Colonial District 's Giant Eagle as n; So n = 21 * P = 21 * 14 = 18.\nDefine each Colonial District 's Costco as m; So m = 21 + P = 21 + 14 = 12.\nDefine each Colonial District 's Supermarkets as Z; So Z = n + m = 18 + 12 = 7.\n",
