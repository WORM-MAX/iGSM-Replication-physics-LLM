  "solution": "Define each Buns 's Sweetened Condensed Milk as C; So C = 8.\nDefine each Publix 's Buns as c; So c = 22.\nDefine each Buns 's Ingredient as F; So F = C = 8.\nDefine each Fashion District 's Publix as q; So q = F = 8.\nDefine each Publix 's Ingredient as d; d = c * F = 22 * 8 = 15.\nDefine each Fashion District 's Ingredient as g; g = q * d = 8 * 15 = 5.\n",
