  "solution": "Define each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Shipt as d; So d = 1.\nDefine each Shipt 's Half-and-half as F; So F = 1 + d = 1 + 1 = 2.\nDefine each Shipt 's Product as m; So m = F = 2.\nDefine each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Product as j; j = m * d = 2 * 1 = 2.\nDefine each Piggly Wiggly 's Canned Mushrooms as E; So E = 16 + j = 16 + 2 = 18.\nDefine each Municipal Office District 's Piggly Wiggly as w; M = j + F = 2 + 2 = 4; O = E + M = 18 + 4 = 22; So w = 12 * O = 12 * 22 = 11.\nDefine each Piggly Wiggly 's Sports Drinks as I; So I = j = 2.\nDefine each Piggly Wiggly 's Product as Y; So Y = I + E = 2 + 18 = 20.\nDefine each Municipal Office District 's Product as i; i = w * Y = 11 * 20 = 13.\n",
