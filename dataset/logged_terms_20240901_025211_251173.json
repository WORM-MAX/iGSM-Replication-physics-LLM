  "question": "District category contains Silicon Valley, and Courthouse District.\nSupermarkets category contains ShopRite, and Coles (Australia).\nProduct category contains Soda, and Flatbreads.\nThe number of each Coles (Australia) 's Soda equals 10 more than each ShopRite 's Product.\nThe number of each Courthouse District 's Coles (Australia) equals the sum of each ShopRite 's Flatbreads, each Coles (Australia) 's Soda, each ShopRite 's Product, and each Silicon Valley 's Coles (Australia).\nThe number of each Courthouse District 's ShopRite equals the sum of each Courthouse District 's Coles (Australia), each Silicon Valley 's Coles (Australia), and each ShopRite 's Flatbreads.\nThe number of each Silicon Valley 's Coles (Australia) equals 5.\nThe number of each ShopRite 's Flatbreads equals 5 more than each Silicon Valley 's Coles (Australia).\nThe number of each Silicon Valley 's ShopRite equals 21 times each Courthouse District 's Supermarkets.\nHow many ShopRite does Silicon Valley have?",
  "solution": "Define each Silicon Valley 's Coles (Australia) as o; So o = 5.\nDefine each ShopRite 's Flatbreads as R; So R = 5 + o = 5 + 5 = 10.\nDefine each ShopRite 's Product as M; So M = R = 10.\nDefine each Coles (Australia) 's Soda as H; So H = 10 + M = 10 + 10 = 20.\nDefine each Courthouse District 's Coles (Australia) as N; P = M + R = 10 + 10 = 20; z = P + o = 20 + 5 = 2; So N = H + z = 20 + 2 = 22.\nDefine each Courthouse District 's ShopRite as v; i = o + R = 5 + 10 = 15; So v = N + i = 22 + 15 = 14.\nDefine each Courthouse District 's Supermarkets as B; So B = v + N = 14 + 22 = 13.\nDefine each Silicon Valley 's ShopRite as r; So r = 21 * B = 21 * 13 = 20.\n",
