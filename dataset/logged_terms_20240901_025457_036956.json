  "question": "District category contains Media District, Education Park, and Courthouse District.\nSupermarkets category contains Grocery Outlet, Thrive Market, Mitsuwa Marketplace, and Food 4 Less.\nThe number of each Courthouse District 's Thrive Market equals 16 times each Media District 's Food 4 Less.\nThe number of each Media District 's Food 4 Less equals 20.\nThe number of each Education Park 's Thrive Market equals 5.\nThe number of each Courthouse District 's Mitsuwa Marketplace equals the sum of each Education Park 's Thrive Market, each Courthouse District 's Grocery Outlet, each Education Park 's Supermarkets, and each Courthouse District 's Food 4 Less.\nThe number of each Media District 's Grocery Outlet equals 22 times the sum of each Courthouse District 's Food 4 Less, each Courthouse District 's Mitsuwa Marketplace, and each Education Park 's Thrive Market.\nThe number of each Courthouse District 's Food 4 Less equals 13 times each Education Park 's Thrive Market.\nThe number of each Courthouse District 's Grocery Outlet equals 12.\nHow many Food 4 Less does Courthouse District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Education Park 's Thrive Market as E; So E = 5.\nDefine each Courthouse District 's Food 4 Less as z; So z = 13 * E = 13 * 5 = 19.\n",
