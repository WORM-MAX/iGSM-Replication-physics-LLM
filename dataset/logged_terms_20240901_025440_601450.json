  "question": "District category contains Housing Estate, and Library District.\nSupermarkets category contains Wegmans, and Boxed.\nThe number of each Housing Estate 's Wegmans equals 15 times the difference of each Library District 's Wegmans and each Housing Estate 's Boxed.\nThe number of each Library District 's Boxed equals the difference of each Housing Estate 's Boxed and each Housing Estate 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Housing Estate 's Boxed equals 11.\nThe number of each Library District 's Wegmans equals 16 more than each Housing Estate 's Boxed.\nHow many Wegmans does Library District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Housing Estate 's Boxed as u; So u = 11.\nDefine each Library District 's Wegmans as R; So R = 16 + u = 16 + 11 = 4.\n",
