  "question": "District category contains Housing Estate, Ancient City, and Entertainment District.\nSupermarkets category contains Big Lots, Hungryroot, and Misfits Market.\nThe number of each Entertainment District 's Big Lots equals each Ancient City 's Big Lots.\nThe number of each Entertainment District 's Misfits Market equals 10 more than each Entertainment District 's Big Lots.\nThe number of each Housing Estate 's Hungryroot equals 4 more than each Entertainment District 's Hungryroot.\nThe number of each Ancient City 's Misfits Market equals 10.\nThe number of each Housing Estate 's Big Lots equals the sum of each Entertainment District 's Misfits Market and each Ancient City 's Big Lots.\nThe number of each Ancient City 's Big Lots equals each Ancient City 's Misfits Market.\nThe number of each Entertainment District 's Hungryroot equals the sum of each Housing Estate 's Misfits Market and each Entertainment District 's Big Lots.\nThe number of each Ancient City 's Hungryroot equals 19 more than the difference of each Housing Estate 's Big Lots and each Ancient City 's Misfits Market.\nThe number of each Housing Estate 's Misfits Market equals 20 more than each Ancient City 's Hungryroot.\nHow many Hungryroot does Housing Estate have?",
  "solution": "Define each Ancient City 's Misfits Market as K; So K = 10.\nDefine each Ancient City 's Big Lots as p; So p = K = 10.\nDefine each Entertainment District 's Big Lots as C; So C = p = 10.\nDefine each Entertainment District 's Misfits Market as Y; So Y = 10 + C = 10 + 10 = 20.\nDefine each Housing Estate 's Big Lots as z; So z = Y + p = 20 + 10 = 7.\nDefine each Ancient City 's Hungryroot as H; Z = z - K = 7 - 10 = 20; So H = 19 + Z = 19 + 20 = 16.\nDefine each Housing Estate 's Misfits Market as y; So y = 20 + H = 20 + 16 = 13.\nDefine each Entertainment District 's Hungryroot as v; So v = y + C = 13 + 10 = 0.\nDefine each Housing Estate 's Hungryroot as G; So G = 4 + v = 4 + 0 = 4.\n",
