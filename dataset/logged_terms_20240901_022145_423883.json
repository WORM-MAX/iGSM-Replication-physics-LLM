  "question": "District category contains Learning Hub, Research Park, and Fashion District.\nSupermarkets category contains Stop & Shop, Trader Joe's, and Thrive Market.\nThe number of each Fashion District 's Stop & Shop equals 16 times each Learning Hub 's Stop & Shop.\nThe number of each Research Park 's Trader Joe's equals the sum of each Fashion District 's Stop & Shop, each Fashion District 's Supermarkets, and each Learning Hub 's Stop & Shop.\nThe number of each Research Park 's Thrive Market equals 13 times each Fashion District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Learning Hub 's Stop & Shop equals 11.\nHow many Supermarkets does Research Park have?",
  "solution": "Define each Learning Hub 's Stop & Shop as L; So L = 11.\nDefine each Fashion District 's Stop & Shop as W; So W = 16 * L = 16 * 11 = 15.\nDefine each Fashion District 's Supermarkets as t; So t = W = 15.\nDefine each Research Park 's Trader Joe's as V; b = W + t = 15 + 15 = 7; So V = L + b = 11 + 7 = 18.\nDefine each Research Park 's Thrive Market as D; So D = 13 * t = 13 * 15 = 11.\nDefine each Research Park 's Supermarkets as x; So x = V + D = 18 + 11 = 6.\n",
