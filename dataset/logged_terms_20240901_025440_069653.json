  "question": "District category contains Education Park, and University Campus.\nSupermarkets category contains SuperValu, and Makro.\nProduct category contains Chocolate Covered Pretzels, and Pastries.\nThe number of each Education Park 's SuperValu equals 4 times the difference of each SuperValu 's Pastries and each Education Park 's Makro.\nThe number of each SuperValu 's Chocolate Covered Pretzels equals the sum of each Makro 's Pastries, each Makro 's Chocolate Covered Pretzels, each SuperValu 's Pastries, and each University Campus 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each University Campus 's SuperValu equals each Makro 's Chocolate Covered Pretzels.\nThe number of each University Campus 's Makro equals each Education Park 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each SuperValu 's Pastries equals 4.\nThe number of each Makro 's Pastries equals 21 times the sum of each Education Park 's Supermarkets and each Education Park 's Makro.\nThe number of each Makro 's Chocolate Covered Pretzels equals each Makro 's Pastries.\nThe number of each Education Park 's Makro equals each SuperValu 's Pastries.\nHow many Product does Makro have?",
  "solution": "Define each SuperValu 's Pastries as s; So s = 4.\nDefine each Education Park 's Makro as z; So z = s = 4.\nDefine each Education Park 's SuperValu as p; p = s - z = 4 - 4 = 0; So p = 4 * p = 4 * 0 = 0.\nDefine each Education Park 's Supermarkets as K; So K = z + p = 4 + 0 = 4.\nDefine each Makro 's Pastries as w; V = K + z = 4 + 4 = 8; So w = 21 * V = 21 * 8 = 7.\nDefine each Makro 's Chocolate Covered Pretzels as L; So L = w = 7.\nDefine each Makro 's Product as b; So b = L + w = 7 + 7 = 14.\n",
