  "solution": "Define each Weis Markets 's Scones as s; So s = 20.\nDefine each Weis Markets 's Canned Chili as r; So r = 13.\nDefine each Weis Markets 's Product as H; So H = r + s = 13 + 20 = 10.\nDefine each Research Park 's Weis Markets as z; So z = r = 13.\nDefine each Research Park 's Product as F; F = H * z = 10 * 13 = 15.\nDefine each Fashion District 's Trader Joe's as C; So C = 15 + F = 15 + 15 = 7.\nDefine each Fashion District 's Weis Markets as T; So T = C = 7.\nDefine each Fashion District 's Supermarkets as d; So d = T + C = 7 + 7 = 14.\nDefine each Costco 's Scones as Q; So Q = d = 14.\n",
