  "question": "Background: There are 3 types of District: Media District, Warehouse District, and University Campus.\nThere are 3 types of Supermarkets: Stop & Shop, HelloFresh, and Hy-Vee.\nThere are 3 types of Product: Whipped Cream, Lemonade, and Muffins.\nEach Media District has Stop & Shop.\nEach Warehouse District has HelloFresh and Hy-Vee.\nEach University Campus has Hy-Vee and Stop & Shop.\nEach Stop & Shop has Muffins.\nEach HelloFresh has Lemonade.\nEach Hy-Vee has Whipped Cream and Lemonade.\nThe number of each Warehouse District 's Hy-Vee equals 18.\nThe number of each Stop & Shop 's Muffins equals 10 more than each University Campus 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Hy-Vee 's Lemonade equals 2 more than each HelloFresh 's Product.\nThe number of each Hy-Vee 's Whipped Cream equals each Stop & Shop 's Product.\nThe number of each University Campus 's Hy-Vee equals 17.\nThe number of each Warehouse District 's HelloFresh equals 1 more than each University Campus 's Product.\nThe number of each HelloFresh 's Lemonade equals the sum of each Media District 's Product and each Stop & Shop 's Muffins.\nThe number of each Media District 's Stop & Shop equals 6 times each University Campus 's Hy-Vee.\nThe number of each University Campus 's Stop & Shop equals each Media District 's Supermarkets.\nHow many HelloFresh does Warehouse District have?",
  "solution": "Define each University Campus 's Hy-Vee as y; So y = 17.\nDefine each Media District 's Stop & Shop as T; So T = 6 * y = 6 * 17 = 10.\nDefine each Media District 's Supermarkets as o; So o = T = 10.\nDefine each University Campus 's Stop & Shop as A; So A = o = 10.\nDefine each University Campus 's Supermarkets as z; So z = A + y = 10 + 17 = 4.\nDefine each Stop & Shop 's Muffins as l; So l = 10 + z = 10 + 4 = 14.\nDefine each Stop & Shop 's Product as V; So V = l = 14.\nDefine each Media District 's Product as b; b = V * T = 14 * 10 = 2.\nDefine each HelloFresh 's Lemonade as c; So c = b + l = 2 + 14 = 16.\nDefine each HelloFresh 's Product as h; So h = c = 16.\nDefine each Hy-Vee 's Lemonade as E; So E = 2 + h = 2 + 16 = 18.\nDefine each Hy-Vee 's Whipped Cream as k; So k = V = 14.\nDefine each Hy-Vee 's Product as H; So H = k + E = 14 + 18 = 9.\nDefine each University Campus 's Product as B; S = A * y = 10 * 17 = 9; y = V * H = 14 * 9 = 11; So B = S + y = 9 + 11 = 20.\nDefine each Warehouse District 's HelloFresh as n; So n = 1 + B = 1 + 20 = 21.\n",
