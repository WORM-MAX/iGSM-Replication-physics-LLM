  "question": "District category contains Landmark District, Colonial District, and Financial District.\nSupermarkets category contains Save-A-Lot, Target, and SuperValu.\nProduct category contains Whipped Cream, and Wine.\nIngredient category contains Rosemary, and Jam.\nThe number of each Save-A-Lot 's Wine equals each Colonial District 's SuperValu.\nThe number of each Colonial District 's SuperValu equals 19.\nThe number of each Wine 's Rosemary equals 1 more than each SuperValu 's Whipped Cream.\nThe number of each Target 's Wine equals the difference of each Landmark District 's Save-A-Lot and each Save-A-Lot 's Product.\nThe number of each Landmark District 's Save-A-Lot equals the sum of each Save-A-Lot 's Wine, each Colonial District 's SuperValu, and each Save-A-Lot 's Product.\nThe number of each SuperValu 's Whipped Cream equals 15.\nThe number of each Whipped Cream 's Rosemary equals 0.\nThe number of each Financial District 's Target equals the sum of each Target 's Wine, each Save-A-Lot 's Wine, each Landmark District 's Save-A-Lot, and each Colonial District 's SuperValu.\nThe number of each Target 's Whipped Cream equals 19 times each Save-A-Lot 's Wine.\nHow many Product does Financial District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Colonial District 's SuperValu as M; So M = 19.\nDefine each Save-A-Lot 's Wine as r; So r = M = 19.\nDefine each Save-A-Lot 's Product as Q; So Q = r = 19.\nDefine each Landmark District 's Save-A-Lot as E; V = r + M = 19 + 19 = 15; So E = Q + V = 19 + 15 = 11.\nDefine each Target 's Wine as R; So R = E - Q = 11 - 19 = 15.\nDefine each Financial District 's Target as G; M = M + r = 15 + 19 = 15; W = M + E = 15 + 11 = 3; So G = R + W = 15 + 3 = 18.\nDefine each Target 's Whipped Cream as n; So n = 19 * r = 19 * 19 = 16.\nDefine each Target 's Product as L; So L = n + R = 16 + 15 = 8.\nDefine each Financial District 's Product as h; h = G * L = 18 * 8 = 6.\n",
