  "solution": "Define each Senior Living Community 's Thrive Market as r; So r = 14.\nDefine each Shopping District 's Food Lion as F; So F = 22 + r = 22 + 14 = 13.\nDefine each Thrive Market 's Canned Sauces as D; q = F + r = 13 + 14 = 4; So D = 11 * q = 11 * 4 = 21.\nDefine each Thrive Market 's Danish Pastries as b; q = D - F = 21 - 13 = 8; So b = 10 + q = 10 + 8 = 18.\nDefine each Thrive Market 's Protein Shakes as h; A = r + b = 14 + 18 = 9; So h = D + A = 21 + 9 = 7.\nDefine each Thrive Market 's Product as I; a = b + D = 18 + 21 = 16; So I = h + a = 7 + 16 = 0.\n",
