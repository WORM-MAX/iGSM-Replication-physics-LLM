  "question": "District category contains Military District, and Student Housing.\nSupermarkets category contains WinCo Foods, Weis Markets, and ShopRite.\nProduct category contains Yogurt Covered Raisins, and Granola Bars.\nIngredient category contains Quinoa, Dried Fruit, and Wheat Germ.\nThe number of each Yogurt Covered Raisins 's Dried Fruit equals each Military District 's Weis Markets.\nThe number of each Weis Markets 's Yogurt Covered Raisins equals 10 times each Weis Markets 's Granola Bars.\nThe number of each Military District 's Weis Markets equals 11.\nThe number of each Military District 's ShopRite equals each WinCo Foods 's Granola Bars.\nThe number of each WinCo Foods 's Granola Bars equals 19.\nThe number of each ShopRite 's Granola Bars equals the sum of each Weis Markets 's Product, each Military District 's Supermarkets, and each Yogurt Covered Raisins 's Ingredient.\nThe number of each Weis Markets 's Granola Bars equals each Yogurt Covered Raisins 's Ingredient.\nThe number of each Student Housing 's WinCo Foods equals 6.\nThe number of each Granola Bars 's Wheat Germ equals 19 times each Military District 's ShopRite.\nThe number of each Granola Bars 's Quinoa equals each WinCo Foods 's Granola Bars.\nThe number of each Military District 's WinCo Foods equals 0 more than each Weis Markets 's Yogurt Covered Raisins.\nThe number of each Student Housing 's ShopRite equals the sum of each Granola Bars 's Dried Fruit, each WinCo Foods 's Granola Bars, and each Weis Markets 's Yogurt Covered Raisins.\nThe number of each Yogurt Covered Raisins 's Wheat Germ equals 12.\nThe number of each Granola Bars 's Dried Fruit equals 1 more than each WinCo Foods 's Granola Bars.\nThe number of each ShopRite 's Yogurt Covered Raisins equals each Weis Markets 's Yogurt Covered Raisins.\nHow many WinCo Foods does Military District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Military District 's Weis Markets as V; So V = 11.\nDefine each Yogurt Covered Raisins 's Dried Fruit as K; So K = V = 11.\nDefine each Yogurt Covered Raisins 's Wheat Germ as D; So D = 12.\nDefine each Yogurt Covered Raisins 's Ingredient as k; So k = K + D = 11 + 12 = 0.\nDefine each Weis Markets 's Granola Bars as y; So y = k = 0.\nDefine each Weis Markets 's Yogurt Covered Raisins as f; So f = 10 * y = 10 * 0 = 0.\nDefine each Military District 's WinCo Foods as o; So o = 0 + f = 0 + 0 = 0.\n",
