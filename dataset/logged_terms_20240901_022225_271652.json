  "question": "District category contains Gated Community, Manufacturing District, and Single-family Homes.\nSupermarkets category contains Wegmans, Aldi, and Earth Fare.\nThe number of each Gated Community 's Aldi equals 20 times the sum of each Single-family Homes 's Aldi, each Single-family Homes 's Supermarkets, and each Gated Community 's Wegmans.\nThe number of each Manufacturing District 's Aldi equals 19 times each Manufacturing District 's Wegmans.\nThe number of each Gated Community 's Wegmans equals 9 more than the sum of each Single-family Homes 's Supermarkets and each Single-family Homes 's Aldi.\nThe number of each Manufacturing District 's Earth Fare equals the difference of each Gated Community 's Earth Fare and each Single-family Homes 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Gated Community 's Earth Fare equals 1 more than the sum of each Gated Community 's Aldi, each Single-family Homes 's Aldi, and each Gated Community 's Wegmans.\nThe number of each Single-family Homes 's Aldi equals 12.\nThe number of each Manufacturing District 's Wegmans equals 16.\nHow many Supermarkets does Gated Community have?",
  "solution": "Define each Single-family Homes 's Aldi as a; So a = 12.\nDefine each Single-family Homes 's Supermarkets as O; So O = a = 12.\nDefine each Gated Community 's Wegmans as H; P = O + a = 12 + 12 = 1; So H = 9 + P = 9 + 1 = 10.\nDefine each Gated Community 's Aldi as u; c = H + O = 10 + 12 = 22; t = a + c = 12 + 22 = 11; So u = 20 * t = 20 * 11 = 13.\nDefine each Gated Community 's Earth Fare as v; y = a + H = 12 + 10 = 22; Y = u + y = 13 + 22 = 12; So v = 1 + Y = 1 + 12 = 13.\nDefine each Gated Community 's Supermarkets as W; X = v + H = 13 + 10 = 0; So W = u + X = 13 + 0 = 13.\n",
