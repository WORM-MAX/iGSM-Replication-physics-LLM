  "question": "District category contains Arts District, Library District, and Government Complex.\nSupermarkets category contains Boxed, and Shipt.\nProduct category contains Plant-based Cheese, and Iced Tea.\nIngredient category contains Star Anise, and Sprinkles.\nThe number of each Government Complex 's Shipt equals 5.\nThe number of each Plant-based Cheese 's Star Anise equals each Plant-based Cheese 's Sprinkles.\nThe number of each Shipt 's Plant-based Cheese equals 12.\nThe number of each Arts District 's Boxed equals the difference of each Plant-based Cheese 's Sprinkles and each Government Complex 's Shipt.\nThe number of each Government Complex 's Boxed equals 14 more than the difference of each Library District 's Product and each Iced Tea 's Star Anise.\nThe number of each Boxed 's Iced Tea equals 9 times the sum of each Government Complex 's Shipt, each Arts District 's Boxed, and each Plant-based Cheese 's Sprinkles.\nThe number of each Library District 's Shipt equals 11 times the sum of each Shipt 's Plant-based Cheese and each Shipt 's Product.\nThe number of each Plant-based Cheese 's Sprinkles equals 18 times each Government Complex 's Shipt.\nThe number of each Iced Tea 's Star Anise equals 0 more than the sum of each Library District 's Product, each Shipt 's Product, and each Government Complex 's Shipt.\nThe number of each Arts District 's Shipt equals the sum of each Shipt 's Product, each Library District 's Supermarkets, each Library District 's Shipt, and each Iced Tea 's Ingredient.\nHow many Product does Library District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Shipt 's Plant-based Cheese as E; So E = 12.\nDefine each Shipt 's Product as L; So L = E = 12.\nDefine each Library District 's Shipt as P; w = E + L = 12 + 12 = 1; So P = 11 * w = 11 * 1 = 11.\nDefine each Library District 's Product as q; q = L * P = 12 * 11 = 17.\n",
