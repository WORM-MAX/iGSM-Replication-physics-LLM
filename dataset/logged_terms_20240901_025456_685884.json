  "question": "District category contains Government Complex, and Research Park.\nSupermarkets category contains E.Leclerc, and Carrefour.\nThe number of each Research Park 's Carrefour equals 11 more than the sum of each Research Park 's E.Leclerc, each Government Complex 's E.Leclerc, and each Government Complex 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Government Complex 's Carrefour equals 17.\nThe number of each Government Complex 's E.Leclerc equals 8 more than each Government Complex 's Carrefour.\nThe number of each Research Park 's E.Leclerc equals 5 times the sum of each Government Complex 's E.Leclerc, each Government Complex 's Supermarkets, and each Government Complex 's Carrefour.\nHow many Supermarkets does Research Park have?",
  "solution": "Define each Government Complex 's Carrefour as l; So l = 17.\nDefine each Government Complex 's E.Leclerc as o; So o = 8 + l = 8 + 17 = 2.\nDefine each Government Complex 's Supermarkets as C; So C = l + o = 17 + 2 = 19.\nDefine each Research Park 's E.Leclerc as V; D = o + l = 2 + 17 = 19; z = C + D = 19 + 19 = 15; So V = 5 * z = 5 * 15 = 6.\nDefine each Research Park 's Carrefour as W; Y = o + V = 2 + 6 = 8; h = C + Y = 19 + 8 = 4; So W = 11 + h = 11 + 4 = 15.\nDefine each Research Park 's Supermarkets as p; So p = W + V = 15 + 6 = 21.\n",
