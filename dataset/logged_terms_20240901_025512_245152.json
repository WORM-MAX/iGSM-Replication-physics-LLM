  "question": "District category contains Automotive District, Historic Neighborhood, Archaeological District, and Senior Living Community.\nSupermarkets category contains Wegmans, 99 Cents Only Stores, Lulu Hypermarket, and Big Lots.\nThe number of each Historic Neighborhood 's 99 Cents Only Stores equals 4 times each Automotive District 's 99 Cents Only Stores.\nThe number of each Automotive District 's Lulu Hypermarket equals 14.\nThe number of each Archaeological District 's 99 Cents Only Stores equals 15.\nThe number of each Historic Neighborhood 's Lulu Hypermarket equals 21.\nThe number of each Automotive District 's Wegmans equals 1.\nThe number of each Senior Living Community 's Lulu Hypermarket equals each Archaeological District 's Wegmans.\nThe number of each Historic Neighborhood 's Big Lots equals 5 times the difference of each Historic Neighborhood 's Lulu Hypermarket and each Automotive District 's Wegmans.\nThe number of each Automotive District 's 99 Cents Only Stores equals 19.\nThe number of each Archaeological District 's Wegmans equals 3 more than each Historic Neighborhood 's 99 Cents Only Stores.\nHow many Supermarkets does Senior Living Community have?",
  "solution": "Define each Automotive District 's 99 Cents Only Stores as j; So j = 19.\nDefine each Historic Neighborhood 's 99 Cents Only Stores as f; So f = 4 * j = 4 * 19 = 7.\nDefine each Archaeological District 's Wegmans as h; So h = 3 + f = 3 + 7 = 10.\nDefine each Senior Living Community 's Lulu Hypermarket as W; So W = h = 10.\nDefine each Senior Living Community 's Supermarkets as i; So i = W = 10.\n",
