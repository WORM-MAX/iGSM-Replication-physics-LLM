  "question": "District category contains Learning Hub, Suburban Neighborhood, and Historic Downtown.\nSupermarkets category contains Fry's, E.Leclerc, and Wegmans.\nProduct category contains Canned Peaches, and Lemonade.\nThe number of each Learning Hub 's E.Leclerc equals 1.\nThe number of each Learning Hub 's Fry's equals 2.\nThe number of each Suburban Neighborhood 's Wegmans equals 1 more than each Suburban Neighborhood 's Fry's.\nThe number of each Suburban Neighborhood 's E.Leclerc equals 0.\nThe number of each E.Leclerc 's Canned Peaches equals 5.\nThe number of each Suburban Neighborhood 's Fry's equals 12.\nThe number of each Wegmans 's Lemonade equals each Suburban Neighborhood 's Wegmans.\nThe number of each Wegmans 's Canned Peaches equals 18.\nThe number of each Fry's 's Lemonade equals 4 more than each Wegmans 's Canned Peaches.\nThe number of each Fry's 's Canned Peaches equals the difference of each E.Leclerc 's Product and each Wegmans 's Product.\nThe number of each Historic Downtown 's E.Leclerc equals the sum of each E.Leclerc 's Canned Peaches, each Learning Hub 's Fry's, and each Suburban Neighborhood 's E.Leclerc.\nHow many Lemonade does Fry's have?",
  "solution": "Define each Wegmans 's Canned Peaches as J; So J = 18.\nDefine each Fry's 's Lemonade as x; So x = 4 + J = 4 + 18 = 22.\n",
