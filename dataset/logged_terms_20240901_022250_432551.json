  "question": "District category contains Senior Living Community, and Restaurant District.\nSupermarkets category contains SuperValu, and King Soopers.\nThe number of each Senior Living Community 's King Soopers equals the sum of each Restaurant District 's Supermarkets and each Restaurant District 's King Soopers.\nThe number of each Restaurant District 's King Soopers equals 6.\nHow many Supermarkets does Senior Living Community have?",
  "solution": "Define each Restaurant District 's King Soopers as N; So N = 6.\nDefine each Restaurant District 's Supermarkets as K; So K = N = 6.\nDefine each Senior Living Community 's King Soopers as W; So W = K + N = 6 + 6 = 12.\nDefine each Senior Living Community 's Supermarkets as J; So J = W = 12.\n",
