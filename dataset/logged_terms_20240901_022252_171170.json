  "question": "District category contains Industrial District, Capitol District, and Learning Hub.\nSupermarkets category contains Sam's Club, PriceRite, and Aldi.\nThe number of each Capitol District 's Sam's Club equals each Learning Hub 's Aldi.\nThe number of each Capitol District 's PriceRite equals 6 times the sum of each Industrial District 's PriceRite, each Learning Hub 's Aldi, and each Learning Hub 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Industrial District 's PriceRite equals 2 more than each Learning Hub 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Industrial District 's Aldi equals 17 more than the sum of each Learning Hub 's Aldi and each Industrial District 's PriceRite.\nThe number of each Industrial District 's Sam's Club equals 17 times the sum of each Capitol District 's PriceRite, each Capitol District 's Supermarkets, and each Capitol District 's Sam's Club.\nThe number of each Learning Hub 's PriceRite equals 20 times each Learning Hub 's Aldi.\nThe number of each Learning Hub 's Aldi equals 7.\nHow many PriceRite does Capitol District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Learning Hub 's Aldi as n; So n = 7.\nDefine each Learning Hub 's PriceRite as I; So I = 20 * n = 20 * 7 = 2.\nDefine each Learning Hub 's Supermarkets as i; So i = n + I = 7 + 2 = 9.\nDefine each Industrial District 's PriceRite as W; So W = 2 + i = 2 + 9 = 11.\nDefine each Capitol District 's PriceRite as P; Z = n + i = 7 + 9 = 16; d = W + Z = 11 + 16 = 4; So P = 6 * d = 6 * 4 = 1.\n",
