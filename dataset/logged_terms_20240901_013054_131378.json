  "question": "District category contains Dormitory District, and Restaurant District.\nSupermarkets category contains Big Lots, Vons, and Sam's Club.\nProduct category contains Cheesecake, and Plant-based Milk.\nIngredient category contains Cardamom, and Cornmeal.\nThe number of each Restaurant District 's Big Lots equals 13.\nThe number of each Sam's Club 's Cheesecake equals each Dormitory District 's Big Lots.\nThe number of each Dormitory District 's Sam's Club equals each Big Lots 's Plant-based Milk.\nThe number of each Big Lots 's Plant-based Milk equals 6.\nThe number of each Restaurant District 's Sam's Club equals 7.\nThe number of each Big Lots 's Cheesecake equals 11.\nThe number of each Plant-based Milk 's Cornmeal equals 16.\nThe number of each Cheesecake 's Cardamom equals the sum of each Big Lots 's Plant-based Milk and each Sam's Club 's Plant-based Milk.\nThe number of each Vons 's Cheesecake equals 6 more than each Restaurant District 's Big Lots.\nThe number of each Restaurant District 's Vons equals 18 more than each Dormitory District 's Vons.\nThe number of each Dormitory District 's Vons equals 19.\nThe number of each Cheesecake 's Cornmeal equals each Big Lots 's Plant-based Milk.\nThe number of each Vons 's Plant-based Milk equals 1 times each Plant-based Milk 's Ingredient.\nThe number of each Dormitory District 's Big Lots equals the difference of each Big Lots 's Plant-based Milk and each Cheesecake 's Cardamom.\nThe number of each Sam's Club 's Plant-based Milk equals 19.\nThe number of each Plant-based Milk 's Cardamom equals 4 more than the sum of each Cheesecake 's Cardamom and each Restaurant District 's Vons.\nHow many Vons does Restaurant District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Dormitory District 's Vons as D; So D = 19.\nDefine each Restaurant District 's Vons as i; So i = 18 + D = 18 + 19 = 14.\n",
