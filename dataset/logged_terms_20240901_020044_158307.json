  "solution": "Define each FreshDirect 's Tortilla Chips as Y; So Y = 15.\nDefine each Wall Street 's Save-A-Lot as b; So b = Y = 15.\nDefine each Research Park 's Save-A-Lot as X; So X = 9 + b = 9 + 15 = 1.\nDefine each Research Park 's FreshDirect as s; So s = 1 * Y = 1 * 15 = 15.\nDefine each Research Park 's Supermarkets as r; So r = X + s = 1 + 15 = 16.\nDefine each FreshDirect 's Dried Fruit as m; k = Y + b = 15 + 15 = 7; So m = r + k = 16 + 7 = 0.\n",
