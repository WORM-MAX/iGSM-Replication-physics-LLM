  "question": "District category contains Municipal Office District, High-rise Apartment Complex, and Landmark District.\nSupermarkets category contains Aldi, Earth Fare, and Coles (Australia).\nProduct category contains Scones, Doughnuts, and Chocolate Covered Pretzels.\nIngredient category contains Mayonnaise, Nutmeg, and Couscous.\nThe number of each Scones 's Nutmeg equals each Chocolate Covered Pretzels 's Couscous.\nThe number of each Scones 's Mayonnaise equals 17.\nThe number of each Coles (Australia) 's Doughnuts equals the sum of each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Product, each Aldi 's Chocolate Covered Pretzels, each Landmark District 's Supermarkets, and each Landmark District 's Aldi.\nThe number of each Earth Fare 's Chocolate Covered Pretzels equals each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Earth Fare.\nThe number of each Aldi 's Chocolate Covered Pretzels equals 13.\nThe number of each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Earth Fare equals 17 times each Earth Fare 's Scones.\nThe number of each Chocolate Covered Pretzels 's Couscous equals 5 more than the sum of each Aldi 's Chocolate Covered Pretzels and each Municipal Office District 's Coles (Australia).\nThe number of each Aldi 's Doughnuts equals the difference of each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Supermarkets and each Earth Fare 's Scones.\nThe number of each Doughnuts 's Couscous equals the difference of each Coles (Australia) 's Doughnuts and each Municipal Office District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Municipal Office District 's Coles (Australia) equals 18 more than each Aldi 's Chocolate Covered Pretzels.\nThe number of each Earth Fare 's Scones equals 14.\nThe number of each Landmark District 's Aldi equals 6 times the sum of each Earth Fare 's Product, each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Product, and each Earth Fare 's Chocolate Covered Pretzels.\nHow many Aldi does Landmark District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Earth Fare 's Scones as G; So G = 14.\nDefine each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Earth Fare as N; So N = 17 * G = 17 * 14 = 8.\nDefine each Earth Fare 's Chocolate Covered Pretzels as n; So n = N = 8.\nDefine each Earth Fare 's Product as j; So j = n + G = 8 + 14 = 22.\nDefine each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Product as d; d = j * N = 22 * 8 = 15.\nDefine each Landmark District 's Aldi as l; g = j + n = 22 + 8 = 7; m = d + g = 15 + 7 = 22; So l = 6 * m = 6 * 22 = 17.\n",
