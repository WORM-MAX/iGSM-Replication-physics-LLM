  "question": "District category contains College Town, Urban Residential Area, and Fashion District.\nSupermarkets category contains Lulu Hypermarket, Vons, and Mitsuwa Marketplace.\nThe number of each College Town 's Vons equals 9 more than the difference of each Fashion District 's Vons and each Urban Residential Area 's Mitsuwa Marketplace.\nThe number of each Fashion District 's Vons equals 20 more than each Urban Residential Area 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Urban Residential Area 's Mitsuwa Marketplace equals 16.\nHow many Supermarkets does College Town have?",
  "solution": "Define each Urban Residential Area 's Mitsuwa Marketplace as a; So a = 16.\nDefine each Urban Residential Area 's Supermarkets as X; So X = a = 16.\nDefine each Fashion District 's Vons as k; So k = 20 + X = 20 + 16 = 13.\nDefine each College Town 's Vons as M; C = k - a = 13 - 16 = 20; So M = 9 + C = 9 + 20 = 6.\nDefine each College Town 's Supermarkets as O; So O = M = 6.\n",
