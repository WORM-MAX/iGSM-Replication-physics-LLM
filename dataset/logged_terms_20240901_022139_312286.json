  "question": "District category contains Capitol District, School District, and Embassy Row.\nSupermarkets category contains Morrisons, Family Dollar, and Gelson's Markets.\nThe number of each School District 's Family Dollar equals 21 times each Embassy Row 's Family Dollar.\nThe number of each Embassy Row 's Gelson's Markets equals 8 more than each School District 's Family Dollar.\nThe number of each Capitol District 's Morrisons equals the sum of each Embassy Row 's Gelson's Markets, each Embassy Row 's Morrisons, each Embassy Row 's Family Dollar, and each School District 's Morrisons.\nThe number of each Embassy Row 's Morrisons equals the sum of each Embassy Row 's Gelson's Markets and each School District 's Family Dollar.\nThe number of each Embassy Row 's Family Dollar equals 5.\nThe number of each School District 's Morrisons equals 4.\nThe number of each Capitol District 's Family Dollar equals 6 more than each Embassy Row 's Morrisons.\nThe number of each School District 's Gelson's Markets equals 13.\nThe number of each Capitol District 's Gelson's Markets equals 8.\nHow many Family Dollar does Capitol District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Embassy Row 's Family Dollar as c; So c = 5.\nDefine each School District 's Family Dollar as P; So P = 21 * c = 21 * 5 = 13.\nDefine each Embassy Row 's Gelson's Markets as y; So y = 8 + P = 8 + 13 = 21.\nDefine each Embassy Row 's Morrisons as n; So n = y + P = 21 + 13 = 11.\nDefine each Capitol District 's Family Dollar as R; So R = 6 + n = 6 + 11 = 17.\n",
