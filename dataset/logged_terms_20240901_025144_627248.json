  "question": "District category contains Entertainment District, Military District, and Landmark District.\nSupermarkets category contains Lidl, Misfits Market, and Walmart.\nThe number of each Landmark District 's Misfits Market equals 8 times each Military District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Military District 's Lidl equals 17.\nThe number of each Entertainment District 's Misfits Market equals 5 more than the sum of each Landmark District 's Misfits Market and each Military District 's Supermarkets.\nHow many Supermarkets does Landmark District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Military District 's Lidl as u; So u = 17.\nDefine each Military District 's Supermarkets as C; So C = u = 17.\nDefine each Landmark District 's Misfits Market as U; So U = 8 * C = 8 * 17 = 21.\nDefine each Landmark District 's Supermarkets as I; So I = U = 21.\n",
