  "question": "District category contains Media District, and Single-family Homes.\nSupermarkets category contains SuperValu, and Aldi.\nThe number of each Media District 's Aldi equals the sum of each Single-family Homes 's Aldi, each Single-family Homes 's Supermarkets, and each Single-family Homes 's SuperValu.\nThe number of each Single-family Homes 's SuperValu equals 5.\nThe number of each Single-family Homes 's Aldi equals 2 more than each Single-family Homes 's SuperValu.\nHow many Supermarkets does Media District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Single-family Homes 's SuperValu as U; So U = 5.\nDefine each Single-family Homes 's Aldi as g; So g = 2 + U = 2 + 5 = 7.\nDefine each Single-family Homes 's Supermarkets as P; So P = g + U = 7 + 5 = 12.\nDefine each Media District 's Aldi as T; l = g + U = 7 + 5 = 12; So T = P + l = 12 + 12 = 1.\nDefine each Media District 's Supermarkets as O; So O = T = 1.\n",
