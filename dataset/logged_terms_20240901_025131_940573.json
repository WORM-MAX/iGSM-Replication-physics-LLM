  "question": "District category contains Suburban Neighborhood, Single-family Homes, and Administrative District.\nSupermarkets category contains Big Lots, Target, and Fresh Thyme Market.\nThe number of each Suburban Neighborhood 's Fresh Thyme Market equals 7 more than each Suburban Neighborhood 's Big Lots.\nThe number of each Single-family Homes 's Big Lots equals 0 more than each Single-family Homes 's Fresh Thyme Market.\nThe number of each Administrative District 's Big Lots equals each Suburban Neighborhood 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Single-family Homes 's Fresh Thyme Market equals 4 times each Single-family Homes 's Target.\nThe number of each Single-family Homes 's Target equals 10.\nThe number of each Suburban Neighborhood 's Target equals 12 times each Administrative District 's Target.\nThe number of each Administrative District 's Target equals 14.\nThe number of each Administrative District 's Fresh Thyme Market equals the sum of each Administrative District 's Big Lots, each Suburban Neighborhood 's Supermarkets, each Administrative District 's Target, and each Single-family Homes 's Target.\nThe number of each Suburban Neighborhood 's Big Lots equals 15 more than the sum of each Suburban Neighborhood 's Target and each Administrative District 's Target.\nHow many Big Lots does Administrative District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Administrative District 's Target as i; So i = 14.\nDefine each Suburban Neighborhood 's Target as W; So W = 12 * i = 12 * 14 = 7.\nDefine each Suburban Neighborhood 's Big Lots as y; J = W + i = 7 + 14 = 21; So y = 15 + J = 15 + 21 = 13.\nDefine each Suburban Neighborhood 's Fresh Thyme Market as Z; So Z = 7 + y = 7 + 13 = 20.\nDefine each Suburban Neighborhood 's Supermarkets as c; A = Z + y = 20 + 13 = 10; So c = W + A = 7 + 10 = 17.\nDefine each Administrative District 's Big Lots as v; So v = c = 17.\n",
