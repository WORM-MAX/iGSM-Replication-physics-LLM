  "question": "District category contains Wall Street, Condo District, and College Town.\nSupermarkets category contains Dollar General, H-E-B, and Big Lots.\nProduct category contains Yogurt Covered Raisins, Cheese, and Cheesecake.\nIngredient category contains Polenta, Condensed Milk, and Barley.\nThe number of each Big Lots 's Cheesecake equals 19.\nThe number of each Cheesecake 's Polenta equals 6 more than the difference of each Yogurt Covered Raisins 's Polenta and each Cheese 's Polenta.\nThe number of each College Town 's Big Lots equals 14.\nThe number of each Condo District 's H-E-B equals each Cheese 's Polenta.\nThe number of each Wall Street 's Big Lots equals 19 more than each Cheesecake 's Polenta.\nThe number of each Yogurt Covered Raisins 's Polenta equals each Cheese 's Polenta.\nThe number of each Cheese 's Polenta equals 10.\nThe number of each Dollar General 's Cheesecake equals 0.\nThe number of each H-E-B 's Yogurt Covered Raisins equals the sum of each Cheesecake 's Polenta, each Wall Street 's Big Lots, each Yogurt Covered Raisins 's Polenta, and each Cheese 's Polenta.\nHow many Product does Condo District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Cheese 's Polenta as D; So D = 10.\nDefine each Yogurt Covered Raisins 's Polenta as m; So m = D = 10.\nDefine each Cheesecake 's Polenta as U; b = m - D = 10 - 10 = 0; So U = 6 + b = 6 + 0 = 6.\nDefine each Wall Street 's Big Lots as d; So d = 19 + U = 19 + 6 = 2.\nDefine each H-E-B 's Yogurt Covered Raisins as W; l = U + D = 6 + 10 = 16; a = l + m = 16 + 10 = 3; So W = d + a = 2 + 3 = 5.\nDefine each H-E-B 's Product as a; So a = W = 5.\nDefine each Condo District 's H-E-B as r; So r = D = 10.\nDefine each Condo District 's Product as q; q = r * a = 10 * 5 = 4.\n",
