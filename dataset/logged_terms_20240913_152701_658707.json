  "question": "Background: There are 3 types of District: Ancient City, Arts District, and Single-family Homes.\nThere are 3 types of Supermarkets: Sainsbury's, Sam's Club, and Food 4 Less.\nEach Ancient City has Food 4 Less, Sam's Club, and Sainsbury's.\nEach Arts District has Food 4 Less, Sam's Club, and Sainsbury's.\nEach Single-family Homes has Sam's Club, Food 4 Less, and Sainsbury's.\nThe number of each Arts District 's Sam's Club equals 7.\nThe number of each Single-family Homes 's Food 4 Less equals 3.\nThe number of each Ancient City 's Sam's Club equals 11 times each Single-family Homes 's Food 4 Less.\nThe number of each Ancient City 's Food 4 Less equals 6 times the sum of each Arts District 's Sam's Club and each Ancient City 's Sainsbury's.\nThe number of each Ancient City 's Sainsbury's equals 5 more than each Arts District 's Sam's Club.\nThe number of each Arts District 's Sainsbury's equals 5 more than each Single-family Homes 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Single-family Homes 's Sam's Club equals 18.\nThe number of each Single-family Homes 's Sainsbury's equals 4 more than each Ancient City 's Sam's Club.\nThe number of each Arts District 's Food 4 Less equals 8 times each Ancient City 's Food 4 Less.\nHow many Sainsbury's does Arts District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Single-family Homes 's Food 4 Less as X; So X = 3.\nDefine each Ancient City 's Sam's Club as o; So o = 11 * X = 11 * 3 = 10.\nDefine each Single-family Homes 's Sam's Club as N; So N = 18.\nDefine each Single-family Homes 's Sainsbury's as x; So x = 4 + o = 4 + 10 = 14.\nDefine each Single-family Homes 's Supermarkets as P; n = x + X = 14 + 3 = 17; So P = N + n = 18 + 17 = 12.\nDefine each Arts District 's Sainsbury's as D; So D = 5 + P = 5 + 12 = 17.\n",
