  "question": "District category contains Senior Living Community, Silicon Valley, and Dormitory District.\nSupermarkets category contains H-E-B, Natural Grocers, and Sprouts Farmers Market.\nProduct category contains Pudding, Canned Artichokes, and Smoothies.\nIngredient category contains Sugar, Buckwheat, and Almond Extract.\nThe number of each Natural Grocers 's Smoothies equals 4 more than each Senior Living Community 's H-E-B.\nThe number of each Pudding 's Almond Extract equals 19.\nThe number of each Dormitory District 's H-E-B equals each Natural Grocers 's Smoothies.\nThe number of each Silicon Valley 's Sprouts Farmers Market equals 0 more than each Pudding 's Almond Extract.\nThe number of each Sprouts Farmers Market 's Smoothies equals 15.\nThe number of each Senior Living Community 's H-E-B equals 20.\nThe number of each H-E-B 's Smoothies equals 5 times the sum of each Silicon Valley 's Ingredient and each Sprouts Farmers Market 's Smoothies.\nThe number of each Smoothies 's Buckwheat equals 12 times each Canned Artichokes 's Sugar.\nThe number of each Canned Artichokes 's Sugar equals 14 more than the difference of each Dormitory District 's H-E-B and each Natural Grocers 's Smoothies.\nHow many Smoothies does H-E-B have?",
  "solution": "Define each Senior Living Community 's H-E-B as n; So n = 20.\nDefine each Natural Grocers 's Smoothies as X; So X = 4 + n = 4 + 20 = 1.\nDefine each Dormitory District 's H-E-B as V; So V = X = 1.\nDefine each Canned Artichokes 's Sugar as C; z = V - X = 1 - 1 = 0; So C = 14 + z = 14 + 0 = 14.\nDefine each Smoothies 's Buckwheat as j; So j = 12 * C = 12 * 14 = 7.\nDefine each Smoothies 's Ingredient as s; So s = j = 7.\nDefine each Pudding 's Almond Extract as v; So v = 19.\nDefine each Silicon Valley 's Sprouts Farmers Market as k; So k = 0 + v = 0 + 19 = 19.\nDefine each Sprouts Farmers Market 's Smoothies as Z; So Z = 15.\nDefine each Sprouts Farmers Market 's Ingredient as e; e = s * Z = 7 * 15 = 13.\nDefine each Silicon Valley 's Ingredient as p; p = k * e = 19 * 13 = 17.\nDefine each H-E-B 's Smoothies as F; Q = p + Z = 17 + 15 = 9; So F = 5 * Q = 5 * 9 = 22.\n",
