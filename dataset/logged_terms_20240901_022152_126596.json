  "question": "District category contains Automotive District, Gated Community, and Student Housing.\nSupermarkets category contains Loblaws, and Lidl.\nProduct category contains Canned Meat, and Canned Spinach.\nThe number of each Student Housing 's Lidl equals 12 times each Lidl 's Product.\nThe number of each Lidl 's Canned Spinach equals 21.\nThe number of each Gated Community 's Loblaws equals 8 more than each Loblaws 's Canned Meat.\nThe number of each Automotive District 's Lidl equals the sum of each Loblaws 's Canned Meat, each Lidl 's Product, each Student Housing 's Product, and each Gated Community 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Loblaws 's Canned Meat equals 14.\nHow many Lidl does Student Housing have?",
  "solution": "Define each Lidl 's Canned Spinach as v; So v = 21.\nDefine each Lidl 's Product as S; So S = v = 21.\nDefine each Student Housing 's Lidl as c; So c = 12 * S = 12 * 21 = 22.\n",
