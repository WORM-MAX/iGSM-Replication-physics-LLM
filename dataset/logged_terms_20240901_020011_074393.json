  "question": "District category contains Market District, Legal District, Urban Residential Area, and Warehouse District.\nSupermarkets category contains Grocery Outlet, Wegmans, Shipt, and FreshDirect.\nThe number of each Urban Residential Area 's Grocery Outlet equals the sum of each Legal District 's FreshDirect, each Legal District 's Grocery Outlet, and each Legal District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Warehouse District 's Shipt equals the difference of each Legal District 's FreshDirect and each Legal District 's Grocery Outlet.\nThe number of each Legal District 's Grocery Outlet equals 7.\nThe number of each Market District 's Shipt equals the sum of each Warehouse District 's Supermarkets and each Legal District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Warehouse District 's FreshDirect equals 7 more than each Urban Residential Area 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Legal District 's FreshDirect equals each Legal District 's Grocery Outlet.\nHow many Supermarkets does Market District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Legal District 's Grocery Outlet as R; So R = 7.\nDefine each Legal District 's FreshDirect as j; So j = R = 7.\nDefine each Legal District 's Supermarkets as m; So m = R + j = 7 + 7 = 14.\nDefine each Urban Residential Area 's Grocery Outlet as Y; n = R + j = 7 + 7 = 14; So Y = m + n = 14 + 14 = 5.\nDefine each Urban Residential Area 's Supermarkets as z; So z = Y = 5.\nDefine each Warehouse District 's FreshDirect as D; So D = 7 + z = 7 + 5 = 12.\nDefine each Warehouse District 's Shipt as w; So w = j - R = 7 - 7 = 0.\nDefine each Warehouse District 's Supermarkets as o; So o = D + w = 12 + 0 = 12.\nDefine each Market District 's Shipt as g; So g = o + m = 12 + 14 = 3.\nDefine each Market District 's Supermarkets as V; So V = g = 3.\n",
