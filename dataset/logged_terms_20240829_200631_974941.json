  "question": "District category contains Preservation District, School District, and Gated Community.\nSupermarkets category contains Loblaws, Natural Grocers, and Food Lion.\nProduct category contains Popcorn, Sparkling Water, and Alcoholic Beverages.\nThe number of each Preservation District 's Natural Grocers equals 18 more than each Natural Grocers 's Popcorn.\nThe number of each Loblaws 's Sparkling Water equals each Loblaws 's Alcoholic Beverages.\nThe number of each Food Lion 's Alcoholic Beverages equals the difference of each Natural Grocers 's Product and each Loblaws 's Sparkling Water.\nThe number of each Preservation District 's Food Lion equals each Gated Community 's Loblaws.\nThe number of each Natural Grocers 's Popcorn equals 12 times each Loblaws 's Product.\nThe number of each Natural Grocers 's Sparkling Water equals the difference of each Preservation District 's Natural Grocers and each Loblaws 's Sparkling Water.\nThe number of each School District 's Food Lion equals 22.\nThe number of each School District 's Natural Grocers equals 21.\nThe number of each Loblaws 's Alcoholic Beverages equals 7.\nThe number of each Gated Community 's Loblaws equals 10 more than each Gated Community 's Natural Grocers.\nThe number of each Gated Community 's Natural Grocers equals each School District 's Natural Grocers.\nHow many Product does Food Lion have?",
  "solution": "Define each Loblaws 's Alcoholic Beverages as n; So n = 7.\nDefine each Loblaws 's Sparkling Water as R; So R = n = 7.\nDefine each Loblaws 's Product as t; So t = n + R = 7 + 7 = 14.\nDefine each Natural Grocers 's Popcorn as e; So e = 12 * t = 12 * 14 = 7.\nDefine each Preservation District 's Natural Grocers as A; So A = 18 + e = 18 + 7 = 2.\nDefine each Natural Grocers 's Sparkling Water as N; So N = A - R = 2 - 7 = 18.\nDefine each Natural Grocers 's Product as y; So y = N + e = 18 + 7 = 2.\nDefine each Food Lion 's Alcoholic Beverages as L; So L = y - R = 2 - 7 = 18.\nDefine each Food Lion 's Product as Z; So Z = L = 18.\n",
