  "question": "District category contains Medical District, Business District, Wall Street, and Landmark District.\nSupermarkets category contains SuperValu, Boxed, Vons, and Sprouts Farmers Market.\nThe number of each Landmark District 's SuperValu equals each Landmark District 's Boxed.\nThe number of each Medical District 's Vons equals 3.\nThe number of each Business District 's Boxed equals 8.\nThe number of each Wall Street 's Sprouts Farmers Market equals 3.\nThe number of each Medical District 's Sprouts Farmers Market equals each Business District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Wall Street 's Boxed equals 7.\nThe number of each Landmark District 's Boxed equals the sum of each Medical District 's Vons, each Business District 's Boxed, and each Wall Street 's SuperValu.\nThe number of each Landmark District 's Vons equals each Medical District 's Vons.\nThe number of each Medical District 's Boxed equals 1.\nThe number of each Wall Street 's Vons equals 15.\nThe number of each Medical District 's SuperValu equals 17 more than each Medical District 's Sprouts Farmers Market.\nThe number of each Business District 's Sprouts Farmers Market equals 13 more than each Business District 's Boxed.\nThe number of each Wall Street 's SuperValu equals each Business District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Business District 's Vons equals each Wall Street 's Boxed.\nHow many SuperValu does Medical District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Wall Street 's Boxed as N; So N = 7.\nDefine each Business District 's Vons as k; So k = N = 7.\nDefine each Business District 's Boxed as d; So d = 8.\nDefine each Business District 's Sprouts Farmers Market as h; So h = 13 + d = 13 + 8 = 21.\nDefine each Business District 's Supermarkets as O; x = d + h = 8 + 21 = 6; So O = k + x = 7 + 6 = 13.\nDefine each Medical District 's Sprouts Farmers Market as u; So u = O = 13.\nDefine each Medical District 's SuperValu as a; So a = 17 + u = 17 + 13 = 7.\n",
