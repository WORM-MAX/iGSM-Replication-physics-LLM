  "solution": "Define each Sainsbury's 's Rice Cakes as a; So a = 1.\nDefine each Rice Cakes 's Quinoa as y; So y = 10 * a = 10 * 1 = 10.\nDefine each Gated Community 's Sainsbury's as b; So b = 12 * y = 12 * 10 = 5.\nDefine each Gated Community 's HelloFresh as z; So z = 22 + b = 22 + 5 = 4.\nDefine each Gated Community 's Supermarkets as I; So I = z + b = 4 + 5 = 9.\nDefine each Flatbreads 's Olive Oil as h; So h = 16 * I = 16 * 9 = 6.\nDefine each Flatbreads 's Quinoa as Q; So Q = z + I = 4 + 9 = 13.\nDefine each Flatbreads 's Ingredient as e; So e = h + Q = 6 + 13 = 19.\nDefine each Landmark District 's HelloFresh as f; So f = e = 19.\nDefine each Sainsbury's 's Flatbreads as o; So o = 17 * f = 17 * 19 = 1.\n",
