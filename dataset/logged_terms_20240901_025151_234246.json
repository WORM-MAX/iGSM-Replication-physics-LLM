  "solution": "Define each Housing Estate 's Sainsbury's as o; So o = 16.\nDefine each Housing Estate 's Bristol Farms as B; So B = 11 * o = 11 * 16 = 15.\nDefine each Arts District 's Sainsbury's as Z; So Z = B - o = 15 - 16 = 22.\nDefine each Arts District 's Bristol Farms as H; So H = 2 + B = 2 + 15 = 17.\nDefine each Heritage District 's Publix as y; So y = B + o = 15 + 16 = 8.\nDefine each Arts District 's Walmart Grocery as g; So g = y - B = 8 - 15 = 16.\nDefine each Arts District 's Publix as d; So d = 13 + y = 13 + 8 = 21.\nDefine each Arts District 's Supermarkets as F; T = d + g = 21 + 16 = 14; Q = T + Z = 14 + 22 = 13; So F = H + Q = 17 + 13 = 7.\n",
