  "question": "District category contains Urban Residential Area, Legal District, Old Town, and Ancient City.\nSupermarkets category contains Peapod, Makro, FreshDirect, and Carrefour.\nThe number of each Legal District 's Peapod equals 19.\nThe number of each Ancient City 's FreshDirect equals 19.\nThe number of each Old Town 's Peapod equals the difference of each Old Town 's Makro and each Old Town 's FreshDirect.\nThe number of each Urban Residential Area 's Carrefour equals 18 times each Legal District 's FreshDirect.\nThe number of each Old Town 's Makro equals each Ancient City 's FreshDirect.\nThe number of each Ancient City 's Makro equals each Old Town 's FreshDirect.\nThe number of each Legal District 's FreshDirect equals the difference of each Old Town 's Supermarkets and each Old Town 's Carrefour.\nThe number of each Ancient City 's Carrefour equals the sum of each Old Town 's Makro, each Ancient City 's FreshDirect, and each Old Town 's Carrefour.\nThe number of each Old Town 's Carrefour equals each Old Town 's Makro.\nThe number of each Old Town 's FreshDirect equals the sum of each Old Town 's Makro and each Ancient City 's FreshDirect.\nHow many Carrefour does Urban Residential Area have?",
  "solution": "Define each Ancient City 's FreshDirect as p; So p = 19.\nDefine each Old Town 's Makro as y; So y = p = 19.\nDefine each Old Town 's FreshDirect as V; So V = y + p = 19 + 19 = 15.\nDefine each Old Town 's Carrefour as W; So W = y = 19.\nDefine each Old Town 's Peapod as t; So t = y - V = 19 - 15 = 4.\nDefine each Old Town 's Supermarkets as I; d = V + t = 15 + 4 = 19; v = d + W = 19 + 19 = 15; So I = y + v = 19 + 15 = 11.\nDefine each Legal District 's FreshDirect as K; So K = I - W = 11 - 19 = 15.\nDefine each Urban Residential Area 's Carrefour as v; So v = 18 * K = 18 * 15 = 17.\n",
