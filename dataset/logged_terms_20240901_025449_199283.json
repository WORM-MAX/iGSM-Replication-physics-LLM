  "solution": "Define each Historic Downtown 's Trader Joe's as t; So t = 11.\nDefine each Shopping District 's Trader Joe's as I; So I = t = 11.\nDefine each Historic Downtown 's Giant Eagle as h; So h = 19.\nDefine each Shopping District 's Giant Eagle as V; So V = h - t = 19 - 11 = 8.\nDefine each Shopping District 's Supermarkets as j; So j = V + I = 8 + 11 = 19.\nDefine each Trader Joe's 's Pudding as T; So T = 19 * j = 19 * 19 = 16.\nDefine each Giant Eagle 's Yogurt as Z; D = T - h = 16 - 19 = 20; So Z = 9 + D = 9 + 20 = 6.\n",
