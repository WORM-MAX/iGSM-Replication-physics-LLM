  "question": "District category contains Entertainment District, Historic Downtown, and Warehouse District.\nSupermarkets category contains Lulu Hypermarket, Boxed, and Earth Fare.\nProduct category contains Pretzels, Canned Vegetables, and Ice Cream.\nThe number of each Earth Fare 's Canned Vegetables equals the difference of each Warehouse District 's Supermarkets and each Entertainment District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Entertainment District 's Boxed equals 11.\nThe number of each Warehouse District 's Earth Fare equals 20 more than each Warehouse District 's Boxed.\nThe number of each Historic Downtown 's Boxed equals 19.\nThe number of each Warehouse District 's Boxed equals 2 more than the sum of each Entertainment District 's Supermarkets and each Entertainment District 's Boxed.\nThe number of each Historic Downtown 's Earth Fare equals each Warehouse District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Lulu Hypermarket 's Canned Vegetables equals 3.\nThe number of each Boxed 's Ice Cream equals 4 more than each Warehouse District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Boxed 's Pretzels equals each Warehouse District 's Earth Fare.\nHow many Earth Fare does Historic Downtown have?",
  "solution": "Define each Entertainment District 's Boxed as p; So p = 11.\nDefine each Entertainment District 's Supermarkets as L; So L = p = 11.\nDefine each Warehouse District 's Boxed as q; r = L + p = 11 + 11 = 22; So q = 2 + r = 2 + 22 = 1.\nDefine each Warehouse District 's Earth Fare as G; So G = 20 + q = 20 + 1 = 21.\nDefine each Warehouse District 's Supermarkets as u; So u = q + G = 1 + 21 = 22.\nDefine each Historic Downtown 's Earth Fare as P; So P = u = 22.\n",
