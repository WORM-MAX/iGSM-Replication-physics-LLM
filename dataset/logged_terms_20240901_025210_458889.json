  "question": "District category contains Wall Street, Administrative District, and Restaurant District.\nSupermarkets category contains Fry's, HelloFresh, and Walmart.\nProduct category contains Brownies, Smoothies, and Tea.\nThe number of each HelloFresh 's Brownies equals the sum of each Walmart 's Smoothies, each Administrative District 's Supermarkets, and each Walmart 's Brownies.\nThe number of each Walmart 's Smoothies equals 15 more than each Walmart 's Brownies.\nThe number of each Wall Street 's Fry's equals 18.\nThe number of each Restaurant District 's Walmart equals 14.\nThe number of each Fry's 's Brownies equals 6 more than the difference of each Walmart 's Product and each Restaurant District 's Fry's.\nThe number of each Restaurant District 's Fry's equals 22 times each Wall Street 's Fry's.\nThe number of each Administrative District 's HelloFresh equals 1 more than the sum of each Walmart 's Brownies and each Walmart 's Smoothies.\nThe number of each Walmart 's Brownies equals 15.\nThe number of each Wall Street 's HelloFresh equals each Administrative District 's Supermarkets.\nHow many Supermarkets does Restaurant District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Wall Street 's Fry's as E; So E = 18.\nDefine each Restaurant District 's Fry's as A; So A = 22 * E = 22 * 18 = 5.\nDefine each Restaurant District 's Walmart as g; So g = 14.\nDefine each Restaurant District 's Supermarkets as c; So c = g + A = 14 + 5 = 19.\n",
