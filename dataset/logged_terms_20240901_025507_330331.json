  "question": "District category contains Housing Estate, Wall Street, and Institute District.\nSupermarkets category contains Fresh Thyme Market, Lidl, and HelloFresh.\nThe number of each Housing Estate 's Lidl equals 22 times each Housing Estate 's HelloFresh.\nThe number of each Wall Street 's HelloFresh equals 0.\nThe number of each Wall Street 's Lidl equals 1 more than each Institute District 's HelloFresh.\nThe number of each Wall Street 's Fresh Thyme Market equals each Institute District 's Fresh Thyme Market.\nThe number of each Housing Estate 's Fresh Thyme Market equals 8.\nThe number of each Institute District 's Lidl equals 11 more than each Housing Estate 's Lidl.\nThe number of each Institute District 's Fresh Thyme Market equals 20.\nThe number of each Institute District 's HelloFresh equals the difference of each Institute District 's Lidl and each Housing Estate 's HelloFresh.\nThe number of each Housing Estate 's HelloFresh equals 18 times each Wall Street 's HelloFresh.\nHow many Lidl does Wall Street have?",
  "solution": "Define each Wall Street 's HelloFresh as p; So p = 0.\nDefine each Housing Estate 's HelloFresh as R; So R = 18 * p = 18 * 0 = 0.\nDefine each Housing Estate 's Lidl as c; So c = 22 * R = 22 * 0 = 0.\nDefine each Institute District 's Lidl as P; So P = 11 + c = 11 + 0 = 11.\nDefine each Institute District 's HelloFresh as v; So v = P - R = 11 - 0 = 11.\nDefine each Wall Street 's Lidl as j; So j = 1 + v = 1 + 11 = 12.\n",
