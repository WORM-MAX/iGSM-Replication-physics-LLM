  "solution": "Define each Pizza Dough 's Cardamom as r; So r = 17.\nDefine each Pizza Dough 's Ingredient as K; So K = r = 17.\nDefine each Loblaws 's Pizza Dough as l; So l = 22 + K = 22 + 17 = 16.\nDefine each Loblaws 's Ingredient as n; n = l * K = 16 * 17 = 19.\nDefine each Library District 's Loblaws as F; So F = n = 19.\nDefine each Library District 's Ingredient as W; W = n * F = 19 * 19 = 16.\nDefine each Medical District 's Sprouts Farmers Market as a; So a = 13 * W = 13 * 16 = 1.\nDefine each Medical District 's Loblaws as N; So N = 3 * K = 3 * 17 = 5.\nDefine each Medical District 's Supermarkets as u; So u = a + N = 1 + 5 = 6.\nDefine each Sprouts Farmers Market 's Pizza Dough as M; So M = 19 + u = 19 + 6 = 2.\nDefine each Sprouts Farmers Market 's Ingredient as q; q = M * K = 2 * 17 = 11.\nDefine each Medical District 's Ingredient as t; U = n * a = 19 * 1 = 19; q = N * q = 5 * 9 = 9; So t = U + q = 19 + 9 = 5.\n",
