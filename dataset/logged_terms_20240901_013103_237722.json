  "question": "District category contains Fashion District, and High-rise Apartment Complex.\nSupermarkets category contains Save-A-Lot, and Safeway.\nThe number of each Fashion District 's Safeway equals 14 times each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Save-A-Lot equals 12 more than each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Safeway.\nThe number of each Fashion District 's Save-A-Lot equals the sum of each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Supermarkets, each Fashion District 's Safeway, each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Save-A-Lot, and each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Safeway.\nThe number of each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Safeway equals 9.\nHow many Supermarkets does Fashion District have?",
  "solution": "Define each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Safeway as I; So I = 9.\nDefine each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Save-A-Lot as w; So w = 12 + I = 12 + 9 = 21.\nDefine each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Supermarkets as S; So S = w + I = 21 + 9 = 7.\nDefine each Fashion District 's Safeway as M; So M = 14 * S = 14 * 7 = 6.\nDefine each Fashion District 's Save-A-Lot as g; N = S + I = 7 + 9 = 16; H = N + w = 16 + 21 = 14; So g = M + H = 6 + 14 = 20.\nDefine each Fashion District 's Supermarkets as Y; So Y = M + g = 6 + 20 = 3.\n",
