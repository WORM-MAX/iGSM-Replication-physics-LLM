  "question": "District category contains Preservation District, and Ancient City.\nSupermarkets category contains Food 4 Less, and Fairway Market.\nThe number of each Ancient City 's Food 4 Less equals 6 more than each Ancient City 's Fairway Market.\nThe number of each Preservation District 's Food 4 Less equals 19.\nThe number of each Ancient City 's Fairway Market equals 20.\nThe number of each Preservation District 's Fairway Market equals 17 more than each Preservation District 's Food 4 Less.\nHow many Supermarkets does Preservation District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Preservation District 's Food 4 Less as p; So p = 19.\nDefine each Preservation District 's Fairway Market as Y; So Y = 17 + p = 17 + 19 = 13.\nDefine each Preservation District 's Supermarkets as d; So d = p + Y = 19 + 13 = 9.\n",
