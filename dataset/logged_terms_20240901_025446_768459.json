  "question": "District category contains Manufacturing District, Legislative District, and Medical District.\nSupermarkets category contains Natural Grocers, Walmart Grocery, and Meijer.\nProduct category contains Buttermilk, and Juice.\nThe number of each Manufacturing District 's Walmart Grocery equals 0.\nThe number of each Natural Grocers 's Buttermilk equals 5 more than each Manufacturing District 's Meijer.\nThe number of each Manufacturing District 's Meijer equals 20.\nThe number of each Meijer 's Buttermilk equals 0.\nThe number of each Medical District 's Meijer equals the difference of each Manufacturing District 's Walmart Grocery and each Natural Grocers 's Juice.\nThe number of each Legislative District 's Walmart Grocery equals 7 more than each Medical District 's Natural Grocers.\nThe number of each Legislative District 's Natural Grocers equals each Meijer 's Buttermilk.\nThe number of each Walmart Grocery 's Juice equals each Walmart Grocery 's Buttermilk.\nThe number of each Legislative District 's Meijer equals each Natural Grocers 's Buttermilk.\nThe number of each Natural Grocers 's Juice equals 13.\nThe number of each Medical District 's Natural Grocers equals 6 more than each Meijer 's Buttermilk.\nThe number of each Meijer 's Juice equals each Meijer 's Buttermilk.\nThe number of each Walmart Grocery 's Buttermilk equals each Medical District 's Natural Grocers.\nHow many Meijer does Legislative District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Manufacturing District 's Meijer as U; So U = 20.\nDefine each Natural Grocers 's Buttermilk as p; So p = 5 + U = 5 + 20 = 2.\nDefine each Legislative District 's Meijer as i; So i = p = 2.\n",
