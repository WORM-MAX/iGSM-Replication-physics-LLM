  "question": "District category contains Business District, Heritage District, and Military District.\nSupermarkets category contains H-E-B, Weis Markets, and Metro (Canada).\nThe number of each Business District 's Weis Markets equals 1.\nThe number of each Military District 's Metro (Canada) equals 5.\nThe number of each Military District 's H-E-B equals 3.\nThe number of each Heritage District 's Metro (Canada) equals 5.\nThe number of each Business District 's Metro (Canada) equals each Military District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Heritage District 's H-E-B equals the sum of each Military District 's H-E-B and each Business District 's H-E-B.\nThe number of each Business District 's H-E-B equals each Military District 's H-E-B.\nThe number of each Military District 's Weis Markets equals 12 more than each Business District 's Weis Markets.\nThe number of each Heritage District 's Weis Markets equals 15 more than the sum of each Military District 's Weis Markets and each Business District 's Weis Markets.\nHow many Weis Markets does Heritage District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Business District 's Weis Markets as d; So d = 1.\nDefine each Military District 's Weis Markets as r; So r = 12 + d = 12 + 1 = 13.\nDefine each Heritage District 's Weis Markets as z; n = r + d = 13 + 1 = 14; So z = 15 + n = 15 + 14 = 6.\n",
