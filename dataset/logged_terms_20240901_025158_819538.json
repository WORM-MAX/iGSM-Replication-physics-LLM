  "question": "District category contains Business District, and Senior Living Community.\nSupermarkets category contains Fairway Market, and Mitsuwa Marketplace.\nThe number of each Business District 's Mitsuwa Marketplace equals 22 more than each Business District 's Fairway Market.\nThe number of each Business District 's Fairway Market equals 21.\nThe number of each Senior Living Community 's Mitsuwa Marketplace equals the difference of each Business District 's Supermarkets and each Business District 's Mitsuwa Marketplace.\nThe number of each Senior Living Community 's Fairway Market equals 7 times each Senior Living Community 's Mitsuwa Marketplace.\nHow many Fairway Market does Senior Living Community have?",
  "solution": "Define each Business District 's Fairway Market as x; So x = 21.\nDefine each Business District 's Mitsuwa Marketplace as G; So G = 22 + x = 22 + 21 = 20.\nDefine each Business District 's Supermarkets as E; So E = G + x = 20 + 21 = 18.\nDefine each Senior Living Community 's Mitsuwa Marketplace as F; So F = E - G = 18 - 20 = 21.\nDefine each Senior Living Community 's Fairway Market as v; So v = 7 * F = 7 * 21 = 9.\n",
