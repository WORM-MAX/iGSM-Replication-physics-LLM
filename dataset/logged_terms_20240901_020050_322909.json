  "question": "District category contains Dormitory District, Legal District, and High School Zone.\nSupermarkets category contains Auchan, Trader Joe's, and SuperValu.\nThe number of each High School Zone 's SuperValu equals 11.\nThe number of each Dormitory District 's SuperValu equals each High School Zone 's Auchan.\nThe number of each Dormitory District 's Auchan equals 18 more than the sum of each High School Zone 's Trader Joe's, each High School Zone 's Auchan, and each Dormitory District 's SuperValu.\nThe number of each High School Zone 's Auchan equals 18 times each High School Zone 's Trader Joe's.\nThe number of each Legal District 's Auchan equals the sum of each Dormitory District 's Auchan, each High School Zone 's Trader Joe's, each Dormitory District 's SuperValu, and each High School Zone 's Auchan.\nThe number of each High School Zone 's Trader Joe's equals 8.\nHow many Auchan does Legal District have?",
  "solution": "Define each High School Zone 's Trader Joe's as A; So A = 8.\nDefine each High School Zone 's Auchan as I; So I = 18 * A = 18 * 8 = 6.\nDefine each Dormitory District 's SuperValu as s; So s = I = 6.\nDefine each Dormitory District 's Auchan as h; Z = I + A = 6 + 8 = 14; p = s + Z = 6 + 14 = 20; So h = 18 + p = 18 + 20 = 15.\nDefine each Legal District 's Auchan as O; f = s + A = 6 + 8 = 14; O = f + I = 14 + 6 = 20; So O = h + O = 15 + 12 = 12.\n",
