  "question": "District category contains Colonial District, Jewelry District, and Research and Innovation Park.\nSupermarkets category contains FreshDirect, Food Lion, and Auchan.\nThe number of each Jewelry District 's Food Lion equals 17 times each Research and Innovation Park 's FreshDirect.\nThe number of each Jewelry District 's FreshDirect equals 7 more than the difference of each Jewelry District 's Food Lion and each Research and Innovation Park 's FreshDirect.\nThe number of each Jewelry District 's Auchan equals 18 more than each Jewelry District 's FreshDirect.\nThe number of each Colonial District 's FreshDirect equals the sum of each Jewelry District 's Auchan and each Research and Innovation Park 's FreshDirect.\nThe number of each Colonial District 's Food Lion equals the difference of each Colonial District 's FreshDirect and each Jewelry District 's FreshDirect.\nThe number of each Research and Innovation Park 's FreshDirect equals 6.\nHow many Food Lion does Colonial District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Research and Innovation Park 's FreshDirect as v; So v = 6.\nDefine each Jewelry District 's Food Lion as u; So u = 17 * v = 17 * 6 = 10.\nDefine each Jewelry District 's FreshDirect as U; K = u - v = 10 - 6 = 4; So U = 7 + K = 7 + 4 = 11.\nDefine each Jewelry District 's Auchan as D; So D = 18 + U = 18 + 11 = 6.\nDefine each Colonial District 's FreshDirect as p; So p = D + v = 6 + 6 = 12.\nDefine each Colonial District 's Food Lion as C; So C = p - U = 12 - 11 = 1.\n",
