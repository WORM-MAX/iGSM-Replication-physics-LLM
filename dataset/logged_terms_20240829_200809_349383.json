  "question": "District category contains Library District, Research and Innovation Park, Archaeological District, and Ancient City.\nSupermarkets category contains Eataly, Weis Markets, Auchan, and Safeway.\nProduct category contains Pizza Dough, Liquor, Doughnuts, and Pretzels.\nThe number of each Weis Markets 's Doughnuts equals 14.\nThe number of each Eataly 's Pizza Dough equals 11 more than each Auchan 's Pretzels.\nThe number of each Auchan 's Pretzels equals the sum of each Library District 's Auchan, each Safeway 's Product, and each Auchan 's Liquor.\nThe number of each Eataly 's Pretzels equals each Research and Innovation Park 's Safeway.\nThe number of each Library District 's Safeway equals 21 more than each Library District 's Auchan.\nThe number of each Research and Innovation Park 's Weis Markets equals 15.\nThe number of each Research and Innovation Park 's Safeway equals 4 more than each Auchan 's Liquor.\nThe number of each Auchan 's Liquor equals 22.\nThe number of each Library District 's Auchan equals 3 more than each Safeway 's Pretzels.\nThe number of each Weis Markets 's Pretzels equals 2.\nThe number of each Safeway 's Pretzels equals 5.\nThe number of each Ancient City 's Auchan equals the sum of each Library District 's Supermarkets and each Library District 's Safeway.\nThe number of each Archaeological District 's Auchan equals 16 times the sum of each Library District 's Supermarkets, each Ancient City 's Supermarkets, and each Safeway 's Product.\nHow many Supermarkets does Ancient City have?",
  "solution": "Define each Safeway 's Pretzels as V; So V = 5.\nDefine each Library District 's Auchan as s; So s = 3 + V = 3 + 5 = 8.\nDefine each Library District 's Safeway as u; So u = 21 + s = 21 + 8 = 6.\nDefine each Library District 's Supermarkets as t; So t = s + u = 8 + 6 = 14.\nDefine each Ancient City 's Auchan as L; So L = t + u = 14 + 6 = 20.\nDefine each Ancient City 's Supermarkets as q; So q = L = 20.\n",
