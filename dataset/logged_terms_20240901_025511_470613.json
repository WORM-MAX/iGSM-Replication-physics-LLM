  "question": "District category contains Medical District, Silicon Valley, and Legal District.\nSupermarkets category contains Fairway Market, Big Lots, and Walmart.\nThe number of each Silicon Valley 's Fairway Market equals 16.\nThe number of each Medical District 's Walmart equals 16.\nThe number of each Silicon Valley 's Big Lots equals 10.\nThe number of each Legal District 's Big Lots equals each Medical District 's Fairway Market.\nThe number of each Legal District 's Fairway Market equals 8.\nThe number of each Medical District 's Fairway Market equals 19 more than each Silicon Valley 's Fairway Market.\nThe number of each Legal District 's Walmart equals each Legal District 's Big Lots.\nThe number of each Silicon Valley 's Walmart equals 21 times each Silicon Valley 's Big Lots.\nThe number of each Medical District 's Big Lots equals 21 times each Medical District 's Fairway Market.\nHow many Big Lots does Medical District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Silicon Valley 's Fairway Market as W; So W = 16.\nDefine each Medical District 's Fairway Market as v; So v = 19 + W = 19 + 16 = 12.\nDefine each Medical District 's Big Lots as f; So f = 21 * v = 21 * 12 = 22.\n",
