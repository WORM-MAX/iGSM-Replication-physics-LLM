  "question": "Background: There are 2 types of District: Military District, and Restaurant District.\nThere are 2 types of Supermarkets: Family Dollar, and Peapod.\nThere are 2 types of Product: Fruit Snacks, and Canned Pineapple.\nEach Military District has Peapod and Family Dollar.\nEach Restaurant District has Peapod and Family Dollar.\nEach Family Dollar has Canned Pineapple and Fruit Snacks.\nEach Peapod has Fruit Snacks and Canned Pineapple.\nThe number of each Restaurant District 's Family Dollar equals the difference of each Military District 's Supermarkets and each Restaurant District 's Peapod.\nThe number of each Family Dollar 's Fruit Snacks equals each Military District 's Peapod.\nThe number of each Peapod 's Canned Pineapple equals each Military District 's Peapod.\nThe number of each Peapod 's Fruit Snacks equals each Peapod 's Canned Pineapple.\nThe number of each Family Dollar 's Canned Pineapple equals each Restaurant District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Military District 's Family Dollar equals 22.\nThe number of each Military District 's Peapod equals each Military District 's Family Dollar.\nThe number of each Restaurant District 's Peapod equals 10 more than each Military District 's Peapod.\nHow many Product does Restaurant District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Military District 's Family Dollar as U; So U = 22.\nDefine each Military District 's Peapod as b; So b = U = 22.\nDefine each Restaurant District 's Peapod as u; So u = 10 + b = 10 + 22 = 9.\nDefine each Military District 's Supermarkets as Q; So Q = U + b = 22 + 22 = 21.\nDefine each Restaurant District 's Family Dollar as J; So J = Q - u = 21 - 9 = 12.\nDefine each Peapod 's Canned Pineapple as r; So r = b = 22.\nDefine each Peapod 's Fruit Snacks as O; So O = r = 22.\nDefine each Peapod 's Product as H; So H = r + O = 22 + 22 = 21.\nDefine each Restaurant District 's Supermarkets as z; So z = u + J = 9 + 12 = 21.\nDefine each Family Dollar 's Canned Pineapple as y; So y = z = 21.\nDefine each Family Dollar 's Fruit Snacks as R; So R = b = 22.\nDefine each Family Dollar 's Product as L; So L = y + R = 21 + 22 = 20.\nDefine each Restaurant District 's Product as f; N = u * H = 9 * 21 = 5; f = J * L = 12 * 20 = 10; So f = N + f = 5 + 15 = 15.\n",
