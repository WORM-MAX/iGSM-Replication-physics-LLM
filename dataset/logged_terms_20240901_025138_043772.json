  "question": "District category contains Heritage District, Wall Street, and Gated Community.\nSupermarkets category contains Family Dollar, Metro (Canada), and Eataly.\nThe number of each Gated Community 's Metro (Canada) equals 22.\nThe number of each Heritage District 's Eataly equals 4 more than each Heritage District 's Metro (Canada).\nThe number of each Gated Community 's Family Dollar equals 17.\nThe number of each Wall Street 's Family Dollar equals 10.\nThe number of each Heritage District 's Metro (Canada) equals 6.\nThe number of each Gated Community 's Eataly equals 9 more than the sum of each Heritage District 's Family Dollar and each Wall Street 's Family Dollar.\nThe number of each Heritage District 's Family Dollar equals each Wall Street 's Family Dollar.\nThe number of each Wall Street 's Eataly equals 14 times the difference of each Heritage District 's Eataly and each Heritage District 's Metro (Canada).\nThe number of each Wall Street 's Metro (Canada) equals 0 times each Heritage District 's Family Dollar.\nHow many Eataly does Heritage District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Heritage District 's Metro (Canada) as u; So u = 6.\nDefine each Heritage District 's Eataly as Y; So Y = 4 + u = 4 + 6 = 10.\n",
