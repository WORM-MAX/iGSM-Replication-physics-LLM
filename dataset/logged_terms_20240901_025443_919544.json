  "solution": "Define each High School Zone 's Food 4 Less as B; So B = 4.\nDefine each Military District 's Food 4 Less as v; So v = 12 * B = 12 * 4 = 2.\nDefine each High School Zone 's Mitsuwa Marketplace as Q; So Q = v = 2.\nDefine each Military District 's Mitsuwa Marketplace as O; V = B + v = 4 + 2 = 6; So O = Q + V = 2 + 6 = 8.\n",
