  "question": "District category contains Historic Neighborhood, Silicon Valley, Academic District, and Shopping District.\nSupermarkets category contains Blue Apron, Auchan, Piggly Wiggly, and Vons.\nThe number of each Historic Neighborhood 's Vons equals 9 more than each Academic District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Silicon Valley 's Vons equals the sum of each Academic District 's Vons, each Shopping District 's Auchan, each Silicon Valley 's Auchan, and each Historic Neighborhood 's Vons.\nThe number of each Academic District 's Auchan equals 0 more than each Shopping District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Academic District 's Piggly Wiggly equals the sum of each Shopping District 's Vons and each Academic District 's Vons.\nThe number of each Silicon Valley 's Blue Apron equals the difference of each Shopping District 's Supermarkets and each Shopping District 's Auchan.\nThe number of each Academic District 's Vons equals 10 times each Academic District 's Auchan.\nThe number of each Shopping District 's Auchan equals 1.\nThe number of each Silicon Valley 's Auchan equals 16 more than each Silicon Valley 's Piggly Wiggly.\nThe number of each Shopping District 's Vons equals 11.\nThe number of each Silicon Valley 's Piggly Wiggly equals 3.\nHow many Supermarkets does Historic Neighborhood have?",
  "solution": "Define each Shopping District 's Vons as p; So p = 11.\nDefine each Shopping District 's Auchan as D; So D = 1.\nDefine each Shopping District 's Supermarkets as K; So K = p + D = 11 + 1 = 12.\nDefine each Academic District 's Auchan as L; So L = 0 + K = 0 + 12 = 12.\nDefine each Academic District 's Vons as E; So E = 10 * L = 10 * 12 = 5.\nDefine each Academic District 's Piggly Wiggly as m; So m = p + E = 11 + 5 = 16.\nDefine each Academic District 's Supermarkets as Q; R = L + m = 12 + 16 = 5; So Q = E + R = 5 + 5 = 10.\nDefine each Historic Neighborhood 's Vons as A; So A = 9 + Q = 9 + 10 = 19.\nDefine each Historic Neighborhood 's Supermarkets as u; So u = A = 19.\n",
