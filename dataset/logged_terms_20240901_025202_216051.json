  "question": "District category contains Urban Residential Area, and Tech Park.\nSupermarkets category contains Carrefour, and Food 4 Less.\nProduct category contains Plant-based Cheese, and Wine.\nIngredient category contains Molasses, and Mayonnaise.\nThe number of each Wine 's Mayonnaise equals 0 times each Urban Residential Area 's Product.\nThe number of each Tech Park 's Carrefour equals the sum of each Wine 's Ingredient and each Carrefour 's Product.\nThe number of each Plant-based Cheese 's Mayonnaise equals the sum of each Urban Residential Area 's Supermarkets and each Tech Park 's Food 4 Less.\nThe number of each Carrefour 's Wine equals 11 times each Urban Residential Area 's Carrefour.\nThe number of each Food 4 Less 's Plant-based Cheese equals 8.\nThe number of each Tech Park 's Food 4 Less equals 17 times each Urban Residential Area 's Ingredient.\nThe number of each Urban Residential Area 's Carrefour equals 8.\nHow many Food 4 Less does Tech Park have?",
  "solution": "Define each Urban Residential Area 's Carrefour as z; So z = 8.\nDefine each Carrefour 's Wine as w; So w = 11 * z = 11 * 8 = 19.\nDefine each Carrefour 's Product as c; So c = w = 19.\nDefine each Urban Residential Area 's Product as s; s = z * c = 8 * 19 = 14.\nDefine each Wine 's Mayonnaise as P; So P = 0 * s = 0 * 14 = 0.\nDefine each Wine 's Ingredient as o; So o = P = 0.\nDefine each Carrefour 's Ingredient as u; u = o * w = 0 * 19 = 0.\nDefine each Urban Residential Area 's Ingredient as K; K = u * z = 0 * 8 = 0.\nDefine each Tech Park 's Food 4 Less as B; So B = 17 * K = 17 * 0 = 0.\n",
