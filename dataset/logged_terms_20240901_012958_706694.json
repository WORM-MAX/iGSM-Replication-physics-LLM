  "question": "District category contains Senior Living Community, and Dormitory District.\nSupermarkets category contains Vons, and Stop & Shop.\nProduct category contains Buns, and Half-and-half.\nIngredient category contains Gelatin, and Pickles.\nThe number of each Buns 's Gelatin equals 13.\nThe number of each Senior Living Community 's Vons equals 1 more than each Stop & Shop 's Buns.\nThe number of each Stop & Shop 's Half-and-half equals each Vons 's Product.\nThe number of each Half-and-half 's Gelatin equals the difference of each Buns 's Pickles and each Half-and-half 's Pickles.\nThe number of each Vons 's Buns equals the difference of each Buns 's Pickles and each Half-and-half 's Ingredient.\nThe number of each Vons 's Half-and-half equals 7 times each Buns 's Pickles.\nThe number of each Buns 's Pickles equals 2.\nThe number of each Stop & Shop 's Buns equals 13.\nThe number of each Dormitory District 's Stop & Shop equals each Vons 's Ingredient.\nThe number of each Half-and-half 's Pickles equals 17.\nHow many Ingredient does Vons have?",
  "solution": "Define each Half-and-half 's Pickles as a; So a = 17.\nDefine each Buns 's Pickles as C; So C = 2.\nDefine each Buns 's Gelatin as l; So l = 13.\nDefine each Half-and-half 's Gelatin as U; So U = C - a = 2 - 17 = 8.\nDefine each Half-and-half 's Ingredient as X; So X = U + a = 8 + 17 = 2.\nDefine each Vons 's Half-and-half as i; So i = 7 * C = 7 * 2 = 14.\nDefine each Buns 's Ingredient as P; So P = l + C = 13 + 2 = 15.\nDefine each Vons 's Buns as j; So j = C - X = 2 - 2 = 0.\nDefine each Vons 's Ingredient as M; h = P * j = 15 * 0 = 0; T = X * i = 2 * 14 = 5; So M = h + T = 0 + 5 = 5.\n",
