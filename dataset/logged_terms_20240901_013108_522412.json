  "question": "District category contains Municipal Office District, and Learning Hub.\nSupermarkets category contains Aldi, and Big Lots.\nProduct category contains Canned Mushrooms, and Granola Bars.\nIngredient category contains Cornmeal, and Jelly.\nThe number of each Big Lots 's Granola Bars equals the sum of each Big Lots 's Canned Mushrooms, each Municipal Office District 's Supermarkets, and each Municipal Office District 's Big Lots.\nThe number of each Learning Hub 's Big Lots equals the sum of each Big Lots 's Product, each Big Lots 's Canned Mushrooms, each Big Lots 's Granola Bars, and each Learning Hub 's Aldi.\nThe number of each Canned Mushrooms 's Cornmeal equals 6.\nThe number of each Learning Hub 's Aldi equals each Aldi 's Granola Bars.\nThe number of each Aldi 's Granola Bars equals 18.\nThe number of each Aldi 's Canned Mushrooms equals each Municipal Office District 's Big Lots.\nThe number of each Big Lots 's Canned Mushrooms equals 14.\nThe number of each Granola Bars 's Jelly equals 14 more than the sum of each Big Lots 's Canned Mushrooms, each Municipal Office District 's Big Lots, and each Aldi 's Canned Mushrooms.\nThe number of each Municipal Office District 's Big Lots equals 0 more than each Big Lots 's Canned Mushrooms.\nHow many Granola Bars does Big Lots have?",
  "solution": "Define each Big Lots 's Canned Mushrooms as k; So k = 14.\nDefine each Municipal Office District 's Big Lots as g; So g = 0 + k = 0 + 14 = 14.\nDefine each Municipal Office District 's Supermarkets as H; So H = g = 14.\nDefine each Big Lots 's Granola Bars as I; C = g + k = 14 + 14 = 5; So I = H + C = 14 + 5 = 19.\n",
