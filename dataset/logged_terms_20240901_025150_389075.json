  "question": "District category contains Gated Community, Courthouse District, and Arts District.\nSupermarkets category contains Eataly, 99 Cents Only Stores, and Bristol Farms.\nThe number of each Courthouse District 's Eataly equals the difference of each Courthouse District 's 99 Cents Only Stores and each Arts District 's Bristol Farms.\nThe number of each Gated Community 's Bristol Farms equals each Courthouse District 's Eataly.\nThe number of each Arts District 's Eataly equals 21.\nThe number of each Courthouse District 's 99 Cents Only Stores equals each Arts District 's Bristol Farms.\nThe number of each Arts District 's Bristol Farms equals 1 more than each Arts District 's Eataly.\nThe number of each Courthouse District 's Bristol Farms equals each Arts District 's Bristol Farms.\nHow many Bristol Farms does Gated Community have?",
  "solution": "Define each Arts District 's Eataly as q; So q = 21.\nDefine each Arts District 's Bristol Farms as Z; So Z = 1 + q = 1 + 21 = 22.\nDefine each Courthouse District 's 99 Cents Only Stores as t; So t = Z = 22.\nDefine each Courthouse District 's Eataly as n; So n = t - Z = 22 - 22 = 0.\nDefine each Gated Community 's Bristol Farms as J; So J = n = 0.\n",
