  "question": "District category contains Medical District, Fashion District, Legal District, and Legislative District.\nSupermarkets category contains H-E-B, SuperValu, Dollar General, and Walmart Grocery.\nThe number of each Medical District 's Dollar General equals each Legal District 's H-E-B.\nThe number of each Fashion District 's SuperValu equals 5 times each Fashion District 's Walmart Grocery.\nThe number of each Medical District 's Walmart Grocery equals 17.\nThe number of each Fashion District 's Walmart Grocery equals the sum of each Legal District 's Dollar General and each Legislative District 's Dollar General.\nThe number of each Legal District 's Walmart Grocery equals 4 times the sum of each Medical District 's Walmart Grocery, each Legal District 's H-E-B, and each Medical District 's Dollar General.\nThe number of each Legislative District 's Dollar General equals 19 times each Legislative District 's H-E-B.\nThe number of each Fashion District 's Dollar General equals each Fashion District 's Walmart Grocery.\nThe number of each Legal District 's Dollar General equals each Legislative District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Legal District 's H-E-B equals 18.\nThe number of each Medical District 's H-E-B equals 5.\nThe number of each Legislative District 's H-E-B equals 20.\nThe number of each Medical District 's SuperValu equals 10.\nThe number of each Legal District 's SuperValu equals each Fashion District 's Supermarkets.\nHow many Supermarkets does Fashion District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Legislative District 's H-E-B as t; So t = 20.\nDefine each Legislative District 's Dollar General as p; So p = 19 * t = 19 * 20 = 12.\nDefine each Legislative District 's Supermarkets as L; So L = t + p = 20 + 12 = 9.\nDefine each Legal District 's Dollar General as F; So F = L = 9.\nDefine each Fashion District 's Walmart Grocery as I; So I = F + p = 9 + 12 = 21.\nDefine each Fashion District 's SuperValu as P; So P = 5 * I = 5 * 21 = 13.\nDefine each Fashion District 's Dollar General as r; So r = I = 21.\nDefine each Fashion District 's Supermarkets as T; O = r + I = 21 + 21 = 19; So T = P + O = 13 + 19 = 9.\n",
