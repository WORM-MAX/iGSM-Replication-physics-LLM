  "solution": "Define each Granola Bars 's Tahini as F; So F = 18.\nDefine each Granola Bars 's Ingredient as b; So b = F = 18.\nDefine each Auchan 's Rice Cakes as q; So q = 9 * b = 9 * 18 = 1.\nDefine each Rice Cakes 's Tahini as P; So P = q + b = 1 + 18 = 19.\nDefine each Family Dollar 's Rice Cakes as C; So C = P = 19.\n",
