  "question": "District category contains Research Park, Institute District, and Research and Innovation Park.\nSupermarkets category contains Fairway Market, Weis Markets, and Hungryroot.\nThe number of each Research and Innovation Park 's Weis Markets equals 8 times each Research Park 's Fairway Market.\nThe number of each Research Park 's Hungryroot equals 20.\nThe number of each Research Park 's Weis Markets equals 14 times each Institute District 's Weis Markets.\nThe number of each Institute District 's Weis Markets equals 16 times each Institute District 's Hungryroot.\nThe number of each Institute District 's Hungryroot equals 9 times each Research and Innovation Park 's Hungryroot.\nThe number of each Research Park 's Fairway Market equals 19.\nThe number of each Research and Innovation Park 's Hungryroot equals 0 more than each Research Park 's Hungryroot.\nHow many Weis Markets does Research Park have?",
  "solution": "Define each Research Park 's Hungryroot as h; So h = 20.\nDefine each Research and Innovation Park 's Hungryroot as B; So B = 0 + h = 0 + 20 = 20.\nDefine each Institute District 's Hungryroot as c; So c = 9 * B = 9 * 20 = 19.\nDefine each Institute District 's Weis Markets as n; So n = 16 * c = 16 * 19 = 5.\nDefine each Research Park 's Weis Markets as w; So w = 14 * n = 14 * 5 = 1.\n",
