  "question": "District category contains Legal District, and Cultural Heritage Site.\nSupermarkets category contains WinCo Foods, and Safeway.\nProduct category contains Sports Drinks, Croissants, and Canned Mushrooms.\nThe number of each Cultural Heritage Site 's WinCo Foods equals 16 more than the difference of each Cultural Heritage Site 's Safeway and each WinCo Foods 's Croissants.\nThe number of each Safeway 's Canned Mushrooms equals the difference of each Cultural Heritage Site 's Supermarkets and each WinCo Foods 's Croissants.\nThe number of each Legal District 's Safeway equals 5.\nThe number of each WinCo Foods 's Canned Mushrooms equals 22 more than the sum of each Safeway 's Product, each Safeway 's Sports Drinks, and each Safeway 's Canned Mushrooms.\nThe number of each WinCo Foods 's Croissants equals 3.\nThe number of each Cultural Heritage Site 's Safeway equals 6 times each WinCo Foods 's Croissants.\nThe number of each Safeway 's Sports Drinks equals the difference of each Cultural Heritage Site 's WinCo Foods and each Cultural Heritage Site 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Legal District 's WinCo Foods equals 4 times each Safeway 's Product.\nHow many WinCo Foods does Legal District have?",
  "solution": "Define each WinCo Foods 's Croissants as Z; So Z = 3.\nDefine each Cultural Heritage Site 's Safeway as p; So p = 6 * Z = 6 * 3 = 18.\nDefine each Cultural Heritage Site 's WinCo Foods as T; L = p - Z = 18 - 3 = 15; So T = 16 + L = 16 + 15 = 8.\nDefine each Cultural Heritage Site 's Supermarkets as z; So z = T + p = 8 + 18 = 3.\nDefine each Safeway 's Canned Mushrooms as F; So F = z - Z = 3 - 3 = 0.\nDefine each Safeway 's Sports Drinks as b; So b = T - z = 8 - 3 = 5.\nDefine each Safeway 's Product as j; So j = b + F = 5 + 0 = 5.\nDefine each Legal District 's WinCo Foods as Y; So Y = 4 * j = 4 * 5 = 20.\n",
