  "question": "District category contains Silicon Valley, Manufacturing District, and Diplomatic Quarter.\nSupermarkets category contains Natural Grocers, Target, and Aldi.\nThe number of each Silicon Valley 's Aldi equals 4 times each Manufacturing District 's Target.\nThe number of each Silicon Valley 's Natural Grocers equals each Diplomatic Quarter 's Aldi.\nThe number of each Diplomatic Quarter 's Aldi equals 2.\nThe number of each Diplomatic Quarter 's Natural Grocers equals 16 more than each Silicon Valley 's Target.\nThe number of each Manufacturing District 's Target equals 13 more than each Diplomatic Quarter 's Target.\nThe number of each Silicon Valley 's Target equals 11.\nThe number of each Diplomatic Quarter 's Target equals 11.\nHow many Natural Grocers does Diplomatic Quarter have?",
  "solution": "Define each Silicon Valley 's Target as H; So H = 11.\nDefine each Diplomatic Quarter 's Natural Grocers as y; So y = 16 + H = 16 + 11 = 4.\n",
