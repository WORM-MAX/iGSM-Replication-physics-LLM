  "question": "District category contains Senior Living Community, Single-family Homes, Entertainment District, and Market District.\nSupermarkets category contains Lidl, Coles (Australia), Metro (Canada), and Instacart.\nThe number of each Entertainment District 's Metro (Canada) equals the sum of each Market District 's Instacart and each Single-family Homes 's Instacart.\nThe number of each Market District 's Coles (Australia) equals 12.\nThe number of each Market District 's Instacart equals 21 more than each Senior Living Community 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Single-family Homes 's Lidl equals 14.\nThe number of each Senior Living Community 's Lidl equals 16 times each Senior Living Community 's Coles (Australia).\nThe number of each Senior Living Community 's Coles (Australia) equals 20.\nThe number of each Single-family Homes 's Metro (Canada) equals each Single-family Homes 's Instacart.\nThe number of each Senior Living Community 's Instacart equals the sum of each Senior Living Community 's Lidl and each Senior Living Community 's Coles (Australia).\nThe number of each Entertainment District 's Instacart equals 1.\nThe number of each Single-family Homes 's Instacart equals 3.\nHow many Instacart does Market District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Senior Living Community 's Coles (Australia) as l; So l = 20.\nDefine each Senior Living Community 's Lidl as C; So C = 16 * l = 16 * 20 = 21.\nDefine each Senior Living Community 's Instacart as A; So A = C + l = 21 + 20 = 18.\nDefine each Senior Living Community 's Supermarkets as B; D = A + C = 18 + 21 = 16; So B = l + D = 20 + 16 = 13.\nDefine each Market District 's Instacart as e; So e = 21 + B = 21 + 13 = 11.\n",
