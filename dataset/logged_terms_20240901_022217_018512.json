  "solution": "Define each Chocolate Covered Pretzels 's Baking Powder as c; So c = 20.\nDefine each Chocolate Covered Pretzels 's Bulgur as r; So r = 14 + c = 14 + 20 = 11.\nDefine each Chocolate Covered Pretzels 's Ingredient as s; So s = r + c = 11 + 20 = 8.\nDefine each Canned Beans 's Baking Powder as v; So v = 11.\nDefine each Vons 's Canned Beans as R; So R = 3 + s = 3 + 8 = 11.\nDefine each Canned Beans 's Bulgur as Q; So Q = 14 * c = 14 * 20 = 4.\nDefine each Vons 's Chocolate Covered Pretzels as i; So i = R = 11.\nDefine each Canned Beans 's Ingredient as m; So m = Q + v = 4 + 11 = 15.\nDefine each Vons 's Ingredient as d; m = s * R = 8 * 11 = 19; L = m * i = 19 * 11 = 2; So d = m + L = 19 + 2 = 21.\n",
