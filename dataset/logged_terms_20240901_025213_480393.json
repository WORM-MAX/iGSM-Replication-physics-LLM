  "question": "District category contains Research and Innovation Park, and Market District.\nSupermarkets category contains Kroger, and Hy-Vee.\nThe number of each Research and Innovation Park 's Hy-Vee equals the sum of each Market District 's Supermarkets and each Market District 's Kroger.\nThe number of each Market District 's Kroger equals 16.\nHow many Hy-Vee does Research and Innovation Park have?",
  "solution": "Define each Market District 's Kroger as O; So O = 16.\nDefine each Market District 's Supermarkets as h; So h = O = 16.\nDefine each Research and Innovation Park 's Hy-Vee as W; So W = h + O = 16 + 16 = 9.\n",
