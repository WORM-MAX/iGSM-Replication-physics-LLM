  "solution": "Define each Diplomatic Quarter 's Save-A-Lot as u; So u = 10.\nDefine each Diplomatic Quarter 's Piggly Wiggly as h; So h = 5 * u = 5 * 10 = 4.\nDefine each Courthouse District 's Lidl as T; So T = 18 + h = 18 + 4 = 22.\nDefine each Courthouse District 's Save-A-Lot as t; So t = u - T = 10 - 22 = 11.\nDefine each Courthouse District 's Piggly Wiggly as r; So r = 15 + h = 15 + 4 = 19.\nDefine each Courthouse District 's Hungryroot as M; So M = 20 * T = 20 * 22 = 3.\nDefine each Courthouse District 's Supermarkets as j; l = t + M = 11 + 3 = 14; Z = l + T = 14 + 22 = 13; So j = r + Z = 19 + 13 = 9.\n",
