  "question": "District category contains Suburban Neighborhood, Legal District, and Archaeological District.\nSupermarkets category contains Fairway Market, Hannaford, and Target.\nProduct category contains Sports Drinks, Pizza Dough, and Yogurt.\nThe number of each Suburban Neighborhood 's Fairway Market equals each Target 's Yogurt.\nThe number of each Legal District 's Fairway Market equals 12.\nThe number of each Target 's Yogurt equals 18.\nThe number of each Hannaford 's Sports Drinks equals 3 times each Legal District 's Fairway Market.\nThe number of each Legal District 's Hannaford equals the sum of each Legal District 's Fairway Market and each Legal District 's Target.\nThe number of each Archaeological District 's Fairway Market equals 14 times the sum of each Suburban Neighborhood 's Supermarkets, each Target 's Yogurt, and each Suburban Neighborhood 's Fairway Market.\nThe number of each Legal District 's Target equals 22 more than each Legal District 's Fairway Market.\nThe number of each Fairway Market 's Pizza Dough equals 11 times the sum of each Archaeological District 's Supermarkets and each Archaeological District 's Fairway Market.\nHow many Product does Suburban Neighborhood have?",
  "solution": "Define each Target 's Yogurt as I; So I = 18.\nDefine each Suburban Neighborhood 's Fairway Market as z; So z = I = 18.\nDefine each Suburban Neighborhood 's Supermarkets as X; So X = z = 18.\nDefine each Archaeological District 's Fairway Market as B; s = z + I = 18 + 18 = 13; n = X + s = 18 + 13 = 8; So B = 14 * n = 14 * 8 = 20.\nDefine each Archaeological District 's Supermarkets as r; So r = B = 20.\nDefine each Fairway Market 's Pizza Dough as Y; m = r + B = 20 + 20 = 17; So Y = 11 * m = 11 * 17 = 3.\nDefine each Fairway Market 's Product as S; So S = Y = 3.\nDefine each Suburban Neighborhood 's Product as p; p = S * z = 3 * 18 = 8.\n",
