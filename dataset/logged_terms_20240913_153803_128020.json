  "solution": "Define each King Soopers 's Plant-based Cheese as X; So X = 9.\nDefine each Family Dollar 's Cookies as D; So D = X = 9.\nDefine each King Soopers 's Cookies as f; So f = D + X = 9 + 9 = 18.\nDefine each King Soopers 's Product as F; So F = f + X = 18 + 9 = 4.\nDefine each High-rise Apartment Complex 's King Soopers as z; So z = F + D = 4 + 9 = 13.\nDefine each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Product as u; u = z * F = 13 * 4 = 6.\nDefine each Cookies 's Nuts as T; So T = 22 * u = 22 * 6 = 17.\nDefine each Cookies 's Chocolate Chips as t; So t = 0 * T = 0 * 17 = 0.\nDefine each Cookies 's Ingredient as I; So I = t + T = 0 + 17 = 17.\nDefine each Vons 's Cookies as m; So m = 1 * I = 1 * 17 = 17.\nDefine each Vons 's Ingredient as U; U = m * I = 17 * 17 = 13.\nDefine each Jewelry District 's Vons as p; So p = 22 * U = 22 * 13 = 10.\nDefine each Jewelry District 's King Soopers as a; So a = m + u = 17 + 6 = 0.\nDefine each Jewelry District 's Supermarkets as y; So y = a + p = 0 + 10 = 10.\nDefine each Cheese 's Cinnamon as v; W = X + D = 9 + 9 = 18; I = W + z = 18 + 13 = 8; So v = y + I = 10 + 8 = 18.\nDefine each Plant-based Cheese 's Nuts as e; Z = F + D = 4 + 9 = 13; So e = v + Z = 18 + 13 = 8.\nDefine each Plant-based Cheese 's Chocolate Chips as C; So C = 10 * e = 10 * 8 = 11.\nDefine each Landmark District 's King Soopers as s; a = f + U = 18 + 13 = 8; So s = C + a = 11 + 8 = 19.\n",
