  "question": "District category contains Industrial District, Tech Park, and Business District.\nSupermarkets category contains Piggly Wiggly, Family Dollar, and Peapod.\nThe number of each Tech Park 's Family Dollar equals 6.\nThe number of each Industrial District 's Peapod equals 21 more than the sum of each Tech Park 's Peapod, each Industrial District 's Piggly Wiggly, and each Tech Park 's Piggly Wiggly.\nThe number of each Tech Park 's Piggly Wiggly equals 20.\nThe number of each Tech Park 's Peapod equals 5 times each Tech Park 's Piggly Wiggly.\nThe number of each Industrial District 's Family Dollar equals each Tech Park 's Family Dollar.\nThe number of each Business District 's Piggly Wiggly equals the sum of each Tech Park 's Peapod, each Industrial District 's Piggly Wiggly, and each Industrial District 's Peapod.\nThe number of each Business District 's Peapod equals 4 times the sum of each Business District 's Piggly Wiggly, each Industrial District 's Piggly Wiggly, and each Industrial District 's Peapod.\nThe number of each Industrial District 's Piggly Wiggly equals 13 more than the difference of each Tech Park 's Peapod and each Tech Park 's Piggly Wiggly.\nHow many Supermarkets does Business District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Tech Park 's Piggly Wiggly as L; So L = 20.\nDefine each Tech Park 's Peapod as I; So I = 5 * L = 5 * 20 = 8.\nDefine each Industrial District 's Piggly Wiggly as H; v = I - L = 8 - 20 = 11; So H = 13 + v = 13 + 11 = 1.\nDefine each Industrial District 's Peapod as p; h = I + L = 8 + 20 = 5; i = H + h = 1 + 5 = 6; So p = 21 + i = 21 + 6 = 4.\nDefine each Business District 's Piggly Wiggly as d; C = H + I = 1 + 8 = 9; So d = p + C = 4 + 9 = 13.\nDefine each Business District 's Peapod as P; E = H + d = 1 + 13 = 14; v = p + E = 4 + 14 = 18; So P = 4 * v = 4 * 18 = 3.\nDefine each Business District 's Supermarkets as N; So N = d + P = 13 + 3 = 16.\n",
