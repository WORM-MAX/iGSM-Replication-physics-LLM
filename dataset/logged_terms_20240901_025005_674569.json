  "question": "District category contains Dormitory District, and Senior Living Community.\nSupermarkets category contains The Fresh Market, and Sprouts Farmers Market.\nProduct category contains Brownies, and Flavored Water.\nIngredient category contains Flour, and Jelly.\nThe number of each Flavored Water 's Jelly equals each Dormitory District 's Ingredient.\nThe number of each The Fresh Market 's Flavored Water equals 14 times the sum of each Sprouts Farmers Market 's Brownies, each Sprouts Farmers Market 's Ingredient, and each Brownies 's Jelly.\nThe number of each Brownies 's Jelly equals 5 times each Dormitory District 's Sprouts Farmers Market.\nThe number of each Senior Living Community 's The Fresh Market equals 20.\nThe number of each Dormitory District 's Sprouts Farmers Market equals 0.\nThe number of each Sprouts Farmers Market 's Brownies equals the sum of each Brownies 's Ingredient, each Brownies 's Jelly, and each Dormitory District 's Sprouts Farmers Market.\nHow many Flavored Water does The Fresh Market have?",
  "solution": "Define each Dormitory District 's Sprouts Farmers Market as D; So D = 0.\nDefine each Brownies 's Jelly as K; So K = 5 * D = 5 * 0 = 0.\nDefine each Brownies 's Ingredient as Q; So Q = K = 0.\nDefine each Sprouts Farmers Market 's Brownies as H; Y = D + K = 0 + 0 = 0; So H = Q + Y = 0 + 0 = 0.\nDefine each Sprouts Farmers Market 's Ingredient as S; S = Q * H = 0 * 0 = 0.\nDefine each The Fresh Market 's Flavored Water as E; M = K + H = 0 + 0 = 0; g = S + M = 0 + 0 = 0; So E = 14 * g = 14 * 0 = 0.\n",
