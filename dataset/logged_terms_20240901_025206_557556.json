  "solution": "Define each Research and Innovation Park 's Central Market as V; So V = 14.\nDefine each Coles (Australia) 's Biscuits as U; So U = V = 14.\nDefine each Research and Innovation Park 's Coles (Australia) as h; So h = 16 + U = 16 + 14 = 7.\nDefine each Military District 's Central Market as M; So M = h + U = 7 + 14 = 21.\nDefine each Coles (Australia) 's Butter as B; So B = M = 21.\nDefine each Central Market 's Butter as x; So x = 5 + B = 5 + 21 = 3.\nDefine each Military District 's Coles (Australia) as y; So y = x = 3.\nDefine each Central Market 's Biscuits as H; So H = y - B = 3 - 21 = 5.\n",
