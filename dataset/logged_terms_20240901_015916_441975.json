  "question": "District category contains High School Zone, Landmark District, Shopping District, and Housing Estate.\nSupermarkets category contains WinCo Foods, and Boxed.\nThe number of each High School Zone 's WinCo Foods equals 4.\nThe number of each High School Zone 's Boxed equals 12 more than each High School Zone 's WinCo Foods.\nThe number of each Landmark District 's WinCo Foods equals 5.\nThe number of each Housing Estate 's Boxed equals 10 more than each High School Zone 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Shopping District 's Boxed equals each High School Zone 's Supermarkets.\nHow many Boxed does Housing Estate have?",
  "solution": "Define each High School Zone 's WinCo Foods as H; So H = 4.\nDefine each High School Zone 's Boxed as E; So E = 12 + H = 12 + 4 = 16.\nDefine each High School Zone 's Supermarkets as Y; So Y = H + E = 4 + 16 = 20.\nDefine each Housing Estate 's Boxed as M; So M = 10 + Y = 10 + 20 = 7.\n",
