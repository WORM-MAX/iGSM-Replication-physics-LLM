  "question": "District category contains Wall Street, Market District, and Senior Living Community.\nSupermarkets category contains Kroger, Carrefour, and Hannaford.\nProduct category contains Flavored Water, Rice Cakes, and Canned Broth.\nThe number of each Wall Street 's Hannaford equals each Carrefour 's Canned Broth.\nThe number of each Carrefour 's Canned Broth equals 6.\nThe number of each Kroger 's Rice Cakes equals 5 more than each Wall Street 's Product.\nThe number of each Senior Living Community 's Hannaford equals 9.\nThe number of each Hannaford 's Flavored Water equals the difference of each Wall Street 's Hannaford and each Carrefour 's Canned Broth.\nThe number of each Market District 's Kroger equals each Kroger 's Rice Cakes.\nHow many Rice Cakes does Kroger have?",
  "solution": "Define each Carrefour 's Canned Broth as M; So M = 6.\nDefine each Wall Street 's Hannaford as y; So y = M = 6.\nDefine each Hannaford 's Flavored Water as Q; So Q = y - M = 6 - 6 = 0.\nDefine each Hannaford 's Product as c; So c = Q = 0.\nDefine each Wall Street 's Product as Y; Y = y * c = 6 * 0 = 0.\nDefine each Kroger 's Rice Cakes as A; So A = 5 + Y = 5 + 0 = 5.\n",
