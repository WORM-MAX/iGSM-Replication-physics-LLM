  "question": "District category contains Arts District, Shopping District, Legislative District, and High School Zone.\nSupermarkets category contains Publix, Central Market, Target, and Safeway.\nThe number of each Legislative District 's Safeway equals the sum of each Arts District 's Central Market, each Shopping District 's Supermarkets, each Arts District 's Supermarkets, and each High School Zone 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Shopping District 's Publix equals 16 more than each High School Zone 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each High School Zone 's Target equals 22 times each Arts District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Arts District 's Central Market equals 9.\nHow many Supermarkets does Legislative District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Arts District 's Central Market as x; So x = 9.\nDefine each Arts District 's Supermarkets as n; So n = x = 9.\nDefine each High School Zone 's Target as v; So v = 22 * n = 22 * 9 = 14.\nDefine each High School Zone 's Supermarkets as P; So P = v = 14.\nDefine each Shopping District 's Publix as y; So y = 16 + P = 16 + 14 = 7.\nDefine each Shopping District 's Supermarkets as w; So w = y = 7.\nDefine each Legislative District 's Safeway as d; k = P + n = 14 + 9 = 0; z = k + x = 0 + 9 = 9; So d = w + z = 7 + 9 = 16.\nDefine each Legislative District 's Supermarkets as M; So M = d = 16.\n",
