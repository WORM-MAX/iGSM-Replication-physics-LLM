  "solution": "Define each Cultural Heritage Site 's Thrive Market as W; So W = 2.\nDefine each Wine 's Star Anise as Q; So Q = W = 2.\nDefine each Milk 's Hoisin Sauce as C; So C = 1.\nDefine each Milk 's Star Anise as S; So S = Q + W = 2 + 2 = 4.\nDefine each Milk 's Ingredient as m; So m = S + C = 4 + 1 = 5.\n",
