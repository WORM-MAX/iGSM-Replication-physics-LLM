  "solution": "Define each Urban Residential Area 's Whole Foods Market as i; So i = 11.\nDefine each Senior Living Community 's Walmart Grocery as C; So C = i = 11.\nDefine each Embassy Row 's Walmart Grocery as x; So x = 20 + C = 20 + 11 = 8.\nDefine each Urban Residential Area 's Walmart Grocery as H; M = C + i = 11 + 11 = 22; y = x + M = 8 + 22 = 7; So H = 16 * y = 16 * 7 = 20.\nDefine each Media District 's Whole Foods Market as v; So v = H - x = 20 - 8 = 12.\nDefine each Media District 's Walmart Grocery as p; So p = v = 12.\nDefine each Embassy Row 's Whole Foods Market as c; So c = 18 * p = 18 * 12 = 9.\nDefine each Senior Living Community 's Kroger as m; C = c - H = 9 - 20 = 12; So m = 12 * C = 12 * 12 = 6.\nDefine each Embassy Row 's Kroger as Q; So Q = m = 6.\n",
