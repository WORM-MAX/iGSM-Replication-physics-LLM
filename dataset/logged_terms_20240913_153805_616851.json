  "question": "Background: There are 2 types of District: High-rise Apartment Complex, and Library District.\nThere are 3 types of Supermarkets: Metro (Canada), King Soopers, and The Fresh Market.\nThere are 2 types of Product: Smoothies, and Alcoholic Beverages.\nThere are 3 types of Ingredient: Cornmeal, Turmeric, and Polenta.\nEach High-rise Apartment Complex has The Fresh Market, King Soopers, and Metro (Canada).\nEach Library District has The Fresh Market, Metro (Canada), and King Soopers.\nEach Metro (Canada) has Alcoholic Beverages.\nEach King Soopers has Smoothies and Alcoholic Beverages.\nEach The Fresh Market has Alcoholic Beverages.\nEach Smoothies has Cornmeal and Turmeric.\nEach Alcoholic Beverages has Polenta, Turmeric, and Cornmeal.\nThe number of each Alcoholic Beverages 's Turmeric equals each Library District 's King Soopers.\nThe number of each Alcoholic Beverages 's Cornmeal equals 22 more than each Alcoholic Beverages 's Turmeric.\nThe number of each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Metro (Canada) equals 22.\nThe number of each Smoothies 's Turmeric equals 10.\nThe number of each High-rise Apartment Complex 's King Soopers equals each Library District 's King Soopers.\nThe number of each King Soopers 's Smoothies equals 10.\nThe number of each The Fresh Market 's Alcoholic Beverages equals the difference of each Alcoholic Beverages 's Ingredient and each Alcoholic Beverages 's Polenta.\nThe number of each Library District 's The Fresh Market equals 9.\nThe number of each Alcoholic Beverages 's Polenta equals each Alcoholic Beverages 's Turmeric.\nThe number of each High-rise Apartment Complex 's The Fresh Market equals 15 more than each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Metro (Canada).\nThe number of each Library District 's King Soopers equals 8 times the difference of each High-rise Apartment Complex 's The Fresh Market and each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Metro (Canada).\nThe number of each Smoothies 's Cornmeal equals each King Soopers 's Product.\nThe number of each Library District 's Metro (Canada) equals 17 times each Library District 's The Fresh Market.\nThe number of each King Soopers 's Alcoholic Beverages equals the sum of each The Fresh Market 's Ingredient and each High-rise Apartment Complex 's The Fresh Market.\nThe number of each Metro (Canada) 's Alcoholic Beverages equals the difference of each Smoothies 's Cornmeal and each The Fresh Market 's Ingredient.\nHow many Ingredient does Metro (Canada) have?",
  "solution": "Define each High-rise Apartment Complex 's Metro (Canada) as H; So H = 22.\nDefine each High-rise Apartment Complex 's The Fresh Market as R; So R = 15 + H = 15 + 22 = 14.\nDefine each Library District 's King Soopers as W; h = R - H = 14 - 22 = 15; So W = 8 * h = 8 * 15 = 5.\nDefine each Alcoholic Beverages 's Turmeric as O; So O = W = 5.\nDefine each Alcoholic Beverages 's Polenta as M; So M = O = 5.\nDefine each Alcoholic Beverages 's Cornmeal as p; So p = 22 + O = 22 + 5 = 4.\nDefine each Alcoholic Beverages 's Ingredient as q; J = p + M = 4 + 5 = 9; So q = O + J = 5 + 9 = 14.\nDefine each The Fresh Market 's Alcoholic Beverages as n; So n = q - M = 14 - 5 = 9.\nDefine each The Fresh Market 's Ingredient as g; g = n * q = 9 * 14 = 11.\nDefine each King Soopers 's Smoothies as a; So a = 10.\nDefine each King Soopers 's Alcoholic Beverages as j; So j = g + R = 11 + 14 = 2.\nDefine each King Soopers 's Product as k; So k = a + j = 10 + 2 = 12.\nDefine each Smoothies 's Cornmeal as G; So G = k = 12.\nDefine each Metro (Canada) 's Alcoholic Beverages as o; So o = G - g = 12 - 11 = 1.\nDefine each Metro (Canada) 's Ingredient as E; E = q * o = 14 * 1 = 14.\n",
