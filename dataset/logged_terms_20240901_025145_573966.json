  "question": "District category contains Gated Community, and Landmark District.\nSupermarkets category contains Piggly Wiggly, and Gelson's Markets.\nProduct category contains Yogurt Covered Raisins, and Custard.\nThe number of each Gated Community 's Gelson's Markets equals 2.\nThe number of each Gelson's Markets 's Custard equals 1 more than each Piggly Wiggly 's Product.\nThe number of each Piggly Wiggly 's Yogurt Covered Raisins equals 5.\nThe number of each Landmark District 's Gelson's Markets equals each Piggly Wiggly 's Yogurt Covered Raisins.\nHow many Supermarkets does Landmark District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Piggly Wiggly 's Yogurt Covered Raisins as Z; So Z = 5.\nDefine each Landmark District 's Gelson's Markets as G; So G = Z = 5.\nDefine each Landmark District 's Supermarkets as q; So q = G = 5.\n",
