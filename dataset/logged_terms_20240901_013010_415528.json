  "question": "District category contains Single-family Homes, Business District, and Civic Center.\nSupermarkets category contains Trader Joe's, ShopRite, and Family Dollar.\nProduct category contains Sparkling Water, Energy Drinks, and Soda.\nThe number of each Family Dollar 's Energy Drinks equals 16 more than each Single-family Homes 's ShopRite.\nThe number of each Civic Center 's Trader Joe's equals 17 times each Business District 's Trader Joe's.\nThe number of each Business District 's Trader Joe's equals 5 more than each Business District 's Family Dollar.\nThe number of each Single-family Homes 's ShopRite equals 13 times each ShopRite 's Sparkling Water.\nThe number of each Single-family Homes 's Family Dollar equals 18 times each ShopRite 's Sparkling Water.\nThe number of each ShopRite 's Sparkling Water equals 22 more than each Civic Center 's ShopRite.\nThe number of each Civic Center 's ShopRite equals each Civic Center 's Trader Joe's.\nThe number of each Trader Joe's 's Sparkling Water equals 3 more than each Family Dollar 's Product.\nThe number of each Family Dollar 's Sparkling Water equals each Single-family Homes 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Business District 's Family Dollar equals 4.\nHow many Product does Trader Joe's have?",
  "solution": "Define each Business District 's Family Dollar as e; So e = 4.\nDefine each Business District 's Trader Joe's as z; So z = 5 + e = 5 + 4 = 9.\nDefine each Civic Center 's Trader Joe's as p; So p = 17 * z = 17 * 9 = 15.\nDefine each Civic Center 's ShopRite as E; So E = p = 15.\nDefine each ShopRite 's Sparkling Water as R; So R = 22 + E = 22 + 15 = 14.\nDefine each Single-family Homes 's ShopRite as r; So r = 13 * R = 13 * 14 = 21.\nDefine each Single-family Homes 's Family Dollar as a; So a = 18 * R = 18 * 14 = 22.\nDefine each Single-family Homes 's Supermarkets as F; So F = r + a = 21 + 22 = 20.\nDefine each Family Dollar 's Sparkling Water as A; So A = F = 20.\nDefine each Family Dollar 's Energy Drinks as x; So x = 16 + r = 16 + 21 = 14.\nDefine each Family Dollar 's Product as c; So c = x + A = 14 + 20 = 11.\nDefine each Trader Joe's 's Sparkling Water as v; So v = 3 + c = 3 + 11 = 14.\nDefine each Trader Joe's 's Product as Z; So Z = v = 14.\n",
