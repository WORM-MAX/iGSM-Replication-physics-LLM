  "question": "District category contains Industrial District, Learning Hub, and Student Housing.\nSupermarkets category contains Gelson's Markets, HelloFresh, and Central Market.\nThe number of each Student Housing 's Central Market equals each Student Housing 's Gelson's Markets.\nThe number of each Learning Hub 's HelloFresh equals 0.\nThe number of each Learning Hub 's Gelson's Markets equals 18.\nThe number of each Industrial District 's Gelson's Markets equals each Student Housing 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Learning Hub 's Central Market equals 1.\nThe number of each Student Housing 's Gelson's Markets equals 7.\nHow many Supermarkets does Industrial District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Student Housing 's Gelson's Markets as o; So o = 7.\nDefine each Student Housing 's Central Market as d; So d = o = 7.\nDefine each Student Housing 's Supermarkets as i; So i = o + d = 7 + 7 = 14.\nDefine each Industrial District 's Gelson's Markets as V; So V = i = 14.\nDefine each Industrial District 's Supermarkets as M; So M = V = 14.\n",
