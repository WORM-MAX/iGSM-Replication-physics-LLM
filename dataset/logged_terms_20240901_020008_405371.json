  "question": "District category contains Diplomatic Quarter, and College Town.\nSupermarkets category contains Giant Eagle, Sam's Club, and Target.\nProduct category contains Dried Fruit, and Cocktail Mixers.\nIngredient category contains Jelly, and Almond Extract.\nThe number of each Target 's Cocktail Mixers equals 5 times each College Town 's Target.\nThe number of each Sam's Club 's Cocktail Mixers equals 18.\nThe number of each Cocktail Mixers 's Almond Extract equals the sum of each Giant Eagle 's Dried Fruit and each Sam's Club 's Product.\nThe number of each Dried Fruit 's Almond Extract equals 2 more than each Diplomatic Quarter 's Giant Eagle.\nThe number of each College Town 's Target equals 19.\nThe number of each Giant Eagle 's Dried Fruit equals each Dried Fruit 's Almond Extract.\nThe number of each Diplomatic Quarter 's Giant Eagle equals 14.\nHow many Ingredient does Giant Eagle have?",
  "solution": "Define each Diplomatic Quarter 's Giant Eagle as R; So R = 14.\nDefine each Dried Fruit 's Almond Extract as Z; So Z = 2 + R = 2 + 14 = 16.\nDefine each Giant Eagle 's Dried Fruit as Q; So Q = Z = 16.\nDefine each Dried Fruit 's Ingredient as f; So f = Z = 16.\nDefine each Giant Eagle 's Ingredient as V; V = Q * f = 16 * 16 = 3.\n",
