  "question": "District category contains Financial District, Market District, Medical District, and Heritage District.\nSupermarkets category contains Central Market, Target, Weis Markets, and Lidl.\nThe number of each Medical District 's Weis Markets equals the difference of each Heritage District 's Weis Markets and each Financial District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Market District 's Central Market equals each Heritage District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Medical District 's Lidl equals 12 more than the sum of each Heritage District 's Supermarkets, each Financial District 's Weis Markets, and each Financial District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Heritage District 's Weis Markets equals 11.\nThe number of each Financial District 's Weis Markets equals each Heritage District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Financial District 's Target equals 3 times each Heritage District 's Weis Markets.\nHow many Supermarkets does Financial District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Heritage District 's Weis Markets as Y; So Y = 11.\nDefine each Heritage District 's Supermarkets as R; So R = Y = 11.\nDefine each Financial District 's Weis Markets as l; So l = R = 11.\nDefine each Financial District 's Target as h; So h = 3 * Y = 3 * 11 = 10.\nDefine each Financial District 's Supermarkets as a; So a = h + l = 10 + 11 = 21.\n",
