  "question": "District category contains Research Park, Education Park, and Historic Neighborhood.\nSupermarkets category contains Aldi, Whole Foods Market, and Misfits Market.\nThe number of each Historic Neighborhood 's Misfits Market equals each Research Park 's Misfits Market.\nThe number of each Research Park 's Aldi equals 18.\nThe number of each Research Park 's Misfits Market equals 17.\nThe number of each Historic Neighborhood 's Aldi equals 8 more than each Research Park 's Aldi.\nThe number of each Historic Neighborhood 's Whole Foods Market equals 2 times the sum of each Historic Neighborhood 's Aldi, each Research Park 's Misfits Market, and each Research Park 's Aldi.\nThe number of each Education Park 's Misfits Market equals 19 times the sum of each Research Park 's Misfits Market and each Historic Neighborhood 's Misfits Market.\nThe number of each Research Park 's Whole Foods Market equals 4 times each Education Park 's Misfits Market.\nThe number of each Education Park 's Whole Foods Market equals 6 times the sum of each Historic Neighborhood 's Whole Foods Market, each Historic Neighborhood 's Aldi, and each Research Park 's Misfits Market.\nThe number of each Education Park 's Aldi equals each Historic Neighborhood 's Aldi.\nHow many Aldi does Historic Neighborhood have?",
  "solution": "Define each Research Park 's Aldi as X; So X = 18.\nDefine each Historic Neighborhood 's Aldi as R; So R = 8 + X = 8 + 18 = 3.\n",
