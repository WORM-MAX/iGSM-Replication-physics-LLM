  "question": "District category contains Suburban Neighborhood, and University Campus.\nSupermarkets category contains Weis Markets, E.Leclerc, and Bristol Farms.\nProduct category contains Sports Drinks, Smoothies, and Protein Shakes.\nIngredient category contains Honey, Wheat Germ, and Mustard.\nThe number of each Weis Markets 's Protein Shakes equals 8.\nThe number of each Bristol Farms 's Sports Drinks equals each Weis Markets 's Smoothies.\nThe number of each Weis Markets 's Smoothies equals each Protein Shakes 's Honey.\nThe number of each Protein Shakes 's Mustard equals 5.\nThe number of each Bristol Farms 's Protein Shakes equals 11 more than the sum of each E.Leclerc 's Protein Shakes, each Sports Drinks 's Honey, and each Weis Markets 's Protein Shakes.\nThe number of each Smoothies 's Mustard equals 19 times each Protein Shakes 's Honey.\nThe number of each E.Leclerc 's Sports Drinks equals the difference of each Suburban Neighborhood 's Bristol Farms and each Protein Shakes 's Honey.\nThe number of each Sports Drinks 's Mustard equals the sum of each Bristol Farms 's Sports Drinks, each Weis Markets 's Smoothies, each E.Leclerc 's Sports Drinks, and each Suburban Neighborhood 's Bristol Farms.\nThe number of each E.Leclerc 's Protein Shakes equals 5 times each Sports Drinks 's Honey.\nThe number of each Suburban Neighborhood 's Bristol Farms equals 16 times each Protein Shakes 's Honey.\nThe number of each Sports Drinks 's Honey equals 6 times each Weis Markets 's Protein Shakes.\nThe number of each Suburban Neighborhood 's E.Leclerc equals each E.Leclerc 's Protein Shakes.\nThe number of each Smoothies 's Honey equals 1.\nThe number of each University Campus 's Weis Markets equals 22.\nThe number of each Protein Shakes 's Honey equals 2.\nHow many Protein Shakes does E.Leclerc have?",
  "solution": "Define each Weis Markets 's Protein Shakes as s; So s = 8.\nDefine each Sports Drinks 's Honey as j; So j = 6 * s = 6 * 8 = 2.\nDefine each E.Leclerc 's Protein Shakes as z; So z = 5 * j = 5 * 2 = 10.\n",
