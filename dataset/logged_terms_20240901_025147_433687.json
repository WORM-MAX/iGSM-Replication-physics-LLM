  "solution": "Define each Heritage District 's H-E-B as K; So K = 4.\nDefine each Heritage District 's Supermarkets as H; So H = K = 4.\nDefine each Gated Community 's H-E-B as k; h = H + K = 4 + 4 = 8; So k = 0 * h = 0 * 8 = 0.\nDefine each Hy-Vee 's Plant-based Milk as f; So f = k + K = 0 + 4 = 4.\n",
