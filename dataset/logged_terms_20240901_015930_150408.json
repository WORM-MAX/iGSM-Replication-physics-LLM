  "question": "District category contains Suburban Neighborhood, Automotive District, and Industrial District.\nSupermarkets category contains H-E-B, Fresh Thyme Market, and Vons.\nThe number of each Suburban Neighborhood 's Vons equals each Suburban Neighborhood 's H-E-B.\nThe number of each Suburban Neighborhood 's H-E-B equals the difference of each Industrial District 's H-E-B and each Automotive District 's H-E-B.\nThe number of each Industrial District 's H-E-B equals 7 times each Automotive District 's H-E-B.\nThe number of each Automotive District 's H-E-B equals 10.\nThe number of each Suburban Neighborhood 's Fresh Thyme Market equals 11 more than each Industrial District 's H-E-B.\nThe number of each Automotive District 's Fresh Thyme Market equals 14 more than each Suburban Neighborhood 's Vons.\nThe number of each Industrial District 's Vons equals 4.\nThe number of each Automotive District 's Vons equals 13 times each Suburban Neighborhood 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Industrial District 's Fresh Thyme Market equals 2.\nHow many Vons does Automotive District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Automotive District 's H-E-B as Q; So Q = 10.\nDefine each Industrial District 's H-E-B as Y; So Y = 7 * Q = 7 * 10 = 1.\nDefine each Suburban Neighborhood 's H-E-B as w; So w = Y - Q = 14 - 10 = 14.\nDefine each Suburban Neighborhood 's Fresh Thyme Market as i; So i = 11 + Y = 11 + 14 = 2.\nDefine each Suburban Neighborhood 's Vons as s; So s = w = 14.\nDefine each Suburban Neighborhood 's Supermarkets as o; r = i + s = 2 + 14 = 16; So o = w + r = 14 + 16 = 7.\nDefine each Automotive District 's Vons as I; So I = 13 * o = 13 * 7 = 22.\n",
