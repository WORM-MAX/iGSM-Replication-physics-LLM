  "question": "District category contains Automotive District, and University Campus.\nSupermarkets category contains Earth Fare, and Auchan.\nProduct category contains Cottage Cheese, and Candy Bars.\nIngredient category contains Sunflower Oil, and Wheat Germ.\nThe number of each University Campus 's Auchan equals 19.\nThe number of each Candy Bars 's Sunflower Oil equals the sum of each Cottage Cheese 's Ingredient and each University Campus 's Auchan.\nThe number of each Candy Bars 's Wheat Germ equals 21.\nThe number of each Cottage Cheese 's Wheat Germ equals 14 times the difference of each University Campus 's Earth Fare and each Candy Bars 's Wheat Germ.\nThe number of each Earth Fare 's Cottage Cheese equals each University Campus 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Auchan 's Candy Bars equals 12 more than each Automotive District 's Auchan.\nThe number of each University Campus 's Earth Fare equals 7.\nThe number of each Automotive District 's Auchan equals 7.\nThe number of each Earth Fare 's Candy Bars equals the sum of each Automotive District 's Product and each Auchan 's Product.\nHow many Candy Bars does Earth Fare have?",
  "solution": "Define each Automotive District 's Auchan as M; So M = 7.\nDefine each Auchan 's Candy Bars as f; So f = 12 + M = 12 + 7 = 19.\nDefine each Auchan 's Product as s; So s = f = 19.\nDefine each Automotive District 's Product as B; B = s * M = 19 * 7 = 18.\nDefine each Earth Fare 's Candy Bars as i; So i = B + s = 18 + 19 = 14.\n",
