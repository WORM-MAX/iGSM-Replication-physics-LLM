  "question": "District category contains Tech Park, School District, and Dormitory District.\nSupermarkets category contains Shipt, Food 4 Less, Kroger, and Lulu Hypermarket.\nThe number of each School District 's Food 4 Less equals the difference of each Dormitory District 's Shipt and each Dormitory District 's Lulu Hypermarket.\nThe number of each Tech Park 's Kroger equals 2 times each Dormitory District 's Lulu Hypermarket.\nThe number of each Tech Park 's Food 4 Less equals 22.\nThe number of each Dormitory District 's Food 4 Less equals each School District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Dormitory District 's Shipt equals 10 times each Dormitory District 's Lulu Hypermarket.\nThe number of each School District 's Shipt equals 21 more than each School District 's Food 4 Less.\nThe number of each Dormitory District 's Kroger equals 2 more than each School District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each School District 's Kroger equals each Dormitory District 's Shipt.\nThe number of each School District 's Lulu Hypermarket equals the sum of each School District 's Shipt, each Dormitory District 's Shipt, each School District 's Food 4 Less, and each School District 's Kroger.\nThe number of each Tech Park 's Shipt equals 17.\nThe number of each Tech Park 's Lulu Hypermarket equals 16.\nThe number of each Dormitory District 's Lulu Hypermarket equals 14.\nHow many Kroger does Dormitory District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Dormitory District 's Lulu Hypermarket as O; So O = 14.\nDefine each Dormitory District 's Shipt as c; So c = 10 * O = 10 * 14 = 2.\nDefine each School District 's Food 4 Less as K; So K = c - O = 2 - 14 = 11.\nDefine each School District 's Kroger as p; So p = c = 2.\nDefine each School District 's Shipt as h; So h = 21 + K = 21 + 11 = 9.\nDefine each School District 's Lulu Hypermarket as x; w = c + h = 2 + 9 = 11; c = w + p = 11 + 2 = 13; So x = K + c = 11 + 13 = 1.\nDefine each School District 's Supermarkets as M; p = x + h = 1 + 9 = 10; K = p + p = 10 + 10 = 20; So M = K + K = 20 + 20 = 17.\nDefine each Dormitory District 's Kroger as F; So F = 2 + M = 2 + 17 = 19.\n",
