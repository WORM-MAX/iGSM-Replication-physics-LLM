  "question": "District category contains Landmark District, and Market District.\nSupermarkets category contains PriceRite, and Stop & Shop.\nProduct category contains Rice Cakes, and Canned Sauces.\nThe number of each Landmark District 's Stop & Shop equals 4.\nThe number of each PriceRite 's Rice Cakes equals 5 times each Landmark District 's Stop & Shop.\nThe number of each Market District 's Stop & Shop equals 6 more than each Stop & Shop 's Product.\nThe number of each PriceRite 's Canned Sauces equals each Market District 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Stop & Shop 's Canned Sauces equals 2 more than each PriceRite 's Rice Cakes.\nThe number of each Stop & Shop 's Rice Cakes equals the sum of each Landmark District 's Stop & Shop, each PriceRite 's Rice Cakes, and each Stop & Shop 's Canned Sauces.\nThe number of each Landmark District 's PriceRite equals the sum of each Market District 's Supermarkets and each Market District 's Stop & Shop.\nThe number of each Market District 's PriceRite equals 8 more than each Stop & Shop 's Canned Sauces.\nHow many PriceRite does Landmark District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Landmark District 's Stop & Shop as a; So a = 4.\nDefine each PriceRite 's Rice Cakes as H; So H = 5 * a = 5 * 4 = 20.\nDefine each Stop & Shop 's Canned Sauces as f; So f = 2 + H = 2 + 20 = 22.\nDefine each Stop & Shop 's Rice Cakes as T; x = f + H = 22 + 20 = 19; So T = a + x = 4 + 19 = 0.\nDefine each Stop & Shop 's Product as i; So i = T + f = 0 + 22 = 22.\nDefine each Market District 's Stop & Shop as D; So D = 6 + i = 6 + 22 = 5.\nDefine each Market District 's PriceRite as O; So O = 8 + f = 8 + 22 = 7.\nDefine each Market District 's Supermarkets as o; So o = O + D = 7 + 5 = 12.\nDefine each Landmark District 's PriceRite as q; So q = o + D = 12 + 5 = 17.\n",
