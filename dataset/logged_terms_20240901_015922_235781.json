  "question": "District category contains Restaurant District, Research and Innovation Park, and Legislative District.\nSupermarkets category contains Save-A-Lot, Natural Grocers, and E.Leclerc.\nThe number of each Restaurant District 's E.Leclerc equals 17 times the difference of each Restaurant District 's Natural Grocers and each Legislative District 's E.Leclerc.\nThe number of each Legislative District 's Save-A-Lot equals the sum of each Legislative District 's E.Leclerc, each Research and Innovation Park 's E.Leclerc, and each Restaurant District 's E.Leclerc.\nThe number of each Restaurant District 's Natural Grocers equals 17 times each Legislative District 's E.Leclerc.\nThe number of each Legislative District 's E.Leclerc equals 13.\nThe number of each Research and Innovation Park 's Save-A-Lot equals each Research and Innovation Park 's E.Leclerc.\nThe number of each Legislative District 's Natural Grocers equals each Restaurant District 's Save-A-Lot.\nThe number of each Research and Innovation Park 's E.Leclerc equals 22 times the difference of each Restaurant District 's E.Leclerc and each Restaurant District 's Natural Grocers.\nThe number of each Research and Innovation Park 's Natural Grocers equals each Legislative District 's Save-A-Lot.\nThe number of each Restaurant District 's Save-A-Lot equals 19 more than each Legislative District 's Save-A-Lot.\nHow many Natural Grocers does Legislative District have?",
  "solution": "Define each Legislative District 's E.Leclerc as g; So g = 13.\nDefine each Restaurant District 's Natural Grocers as o; So o = 17 * g = 17 * 13 = 14.\nDefine each Restaurant District 's E.Leclerc as x; P = o - g = 14 - 13 = 1; So x = 17 * P = 17 * 1 = 17.\nDefine each Research and Innovation Park 's E.Leclerc as Q; G = x - o = 17 - 14 = 3; So Q = 22 * G = 22 * 3 = 20.\nDefine each Legislative District 's Save-A-Lot as k; w = x + g = 17 + 13 = 7; So k = Q + w = 20 + 7 = 4.\nDefine each Restaurant District 's Save-A-Lot as T; So T = 19 + k = 19 + 4 = 0.\nDefine each Legislative District 's Natural Grocers as f; So f = T = 0.\n",
