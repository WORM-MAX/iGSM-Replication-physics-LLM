  "question": "District category contains Single-family Homes, Municipal Office District, Legislative District, and Entertainment District.\nSupermarkets category contains Family Dollar, Sprouts Farmers Market, Earth Fare, and Target.\nProduct category contains Canned Beans, Popcorn, Kefir, and Candy Bars.\nThe number of each Entertainment District 's Sprouts Farmers Market equals the sum of each Single-family Homes 's Target, each Sprouts Farmers Market 's Popcorn, and each Single-family Homes 's Supermarkets.\nThe number of each Earth Fare 's Popcorn equals 7 times each Legislative District 's Product.\nThe number of each Target 's Canned Beans equals 16 more than the sum of each Single-family Homes 's Target and each Sprouts Farmers Market 's Popcorn.\nThe number of each Municipal Office District 's Target equals 9 more than each Earth Fare 's Popcorn.\nThe number of each Legislative District 's Family Dollar equals 1 more than each Target 's Canned Beans.\nThe number of each Sprouts Farmers Market 's Popcorn equals 15.\nThe number of each Family Dollar 's Popcorn equals 13 more than each Entertainment District 's Sprouts Farmers Market.\nThe number of each Target 's Kefir equals 3 times each Entertainment District 's Sprouts Farmers Market.\nThe number of each Target 's Popcorn equals 14.\nThe number of each Single-family Homes 's Target equals 2 times each Sprouts Farmers Market 's Popcorn.\nHow many Popcorn does Earth Fare have?",
  "solution": "Define each Sprouts Farmers Market 's Popcorn as h; So h = 15.\nDefine each Single-family Homes 's Target as D; So D = 2 * h = 2 * 15 = 7.\nDefine each Single-family Homes 's Supermarkets as T; So T = D = 7.\nDefine each Entertainment District 's Sprouts Farmers Market as b; Z = D + h = 7 + 15 = 22; So b = T + Z = 7 + 22 = 6.\nDefine each Family Dollar 's Popcorn as K; So K = 13 + b = 13 + 6 = 19.\nDefine each Target 's Canned Beans as S; c = D + h = 7 + 15 = 22; So S = 16 + c = 16 + 22 = 15.\nDefine each Family Dollar 's Product as n; So n = K = 19.\nDefine each Legislative District 's Family Dollar as B; So B = 1 + S = 1 + 15 = 16.\nDefine each Legislative District 's Product as c; c = B * n = 16 * 19 = 5.\nDefine each Earth Fare 's Popcorn as o; So o = 7 * c = 7 * 5 = 12.\n",
