Question:
The number of Administrative District 's H-E-B equals 7 times Administrative District 's Kroger. The number of Administrative District 's Safeway equals 13 times the difference of Administrative District 's Kroger and Administrative District 's H-E-B. The number of Administrative District 's Kroger equals 14. How many Supermarkets does Administrative District have?

Solution:
Define each Administrative District 's Kroger as b; So b = 14.
Define each Administrative District 's H-E-B as U; So U = 7 * b = 7 * 14 = 98.
Define each Administrative District 's Safeway as z; B = b - U = 14 - 98 = -84; So z = 13 * B = 13 * -84 = -1092.
Define each Administrative District 's Supermarkets as M; s = b + z = 14 + -1092 = -1078; So M = U + s = 98 + -1078 = -980.
