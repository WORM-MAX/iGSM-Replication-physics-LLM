Question:
District category contains Condo District, Heritage District, and Preservation District.
Supermarkets category contains Stop & Shop, and Lidl.
The number of each Preservation District 's Lidl equals each Condo District 's Supermarkets.
The number of each Preservation District 's Stop & Shop equals each Condo District 's Supermarkets.
The number of each Condo District 's Lidl equals 20 more than each Condo District 's Stop & Shop.
The number of each Condo District 's Stop & Shop equals 10.
The number of each Heritage District 's Stop & Shop equals 15 times each Condo District 's Stop & Shop.
The number of each Heritage District 's Lidl equals the sum of each Condo District 's Lidl and each Condo District 's Stop & Shop.
How many Supermarkets does Preservation District have?

Solution:
Define each Condo District 's Stop & Shop as l; So l = 10.
Define each Condo District 's Lidl as d; So d = 20 + l = 20 + 10 = 7.
Define each Condo District 's Supermarkets as V; So V = d + l = 7 + 10 = 17.
Define each Preservation District 's Lidl as O; So O = V = 17.
Define each Preservation District 's Stop & Shop as c; So c = V = 17.
Define each Preservation District 's Supermarkets as E; So E = O + c = 17 + 17 = 11.
