Question:
The number of Old Town 's Loblaws equals 13 times Loblaws 's Canned Beans. The number of Loblaws 's Canned Beans equals 8. The number of Walmart Grocery 's Canned Chili equals 17 times the sum of Old Town 's Loblaws and Loblaws 's Canned Beans. How many Canned Chili does Walmart Grocery have?

Solution:
Define each Loblaws 's Canned Beans as S; So S = 8.
Define each Old Town 's Loblaws as Y; So Y = 13 * S = 13 * 8 = 104.
Define each Walmart Grocery 's Canned Chili as w; f = Y + S = 104 + 8 = 112; So w = 17 * f = 17 * 112 = 1904.
