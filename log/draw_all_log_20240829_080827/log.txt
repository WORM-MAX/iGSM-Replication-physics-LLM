Question:
The number of Legislative District 's Mitsuwa Marketplace equals 22. The number of Dormitory District 's Costco equals 17 more than Legislative District 's Costco. The number of Grocery Outlet 's Scones equals 3. The number of Legislative District 's Costco equals Costco 's Scones. The number of Costco 's Biscuits equals 14 more than Dormitory District 's Supermarkets. The number of Costco 's Scones equals 5 more than Grocery Outlet 's Scones. The number of Dormitory District 's Grocery Outlet equals the sum of Legislative District 's Mitsuwa Marketplace, Legislative District 's Costco, and Legislative District 's Supermarkets. How many Biscuits does Costco have?

Solution:
Define each Grocery Outlet 's Scones as Q; So Q = 3.
Define each Costco 's Scones as z; So z = 5 + Q = 5 + 3 = 8.
Define each Legislative District 's Costco as A; So A = z = 8.
Define each Legislative District 's Mitsuwa Marketplace as n; So n = 22.
Define each Legislative District 's Supermarkets as r; So r = A + n = 8 + 22 = 30.
Define each Dormitory District 's Grocery Outlet as B; H = n + A = 22 + 8 = 30; So B = r + H = 30 + 30 = 60.
Define each Dormitory District 's Costco as b; So b = 17 + A = 17 + 8 = 25.
Define each Dormitory District 's Supermarkets as P; So P = B + b = 60 + 25 = 85.
Define each Costco 's Biscuits as q; So q = 14 + P = 14 + 85 = 99.
