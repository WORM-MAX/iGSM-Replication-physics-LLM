Question:
District category contains College Town, Urban Residential Area, and Fashion District.
Supermarkets category contains Lulu Hypermarket, Vons, and Mitsuwa Marketplace.
The number of each College Town 's Vons equals 9 more than the difference of each Fashion District 's Vons and each Urban Residential Area 's Mitsuwa Marketplace.
The number of each Fashion District 's Vons equals 20 more than each Urban Residential Area 's Supermarkets.
The number of each Urban Residential Area 's Mitsuwa Marketplace equals 16.
How many Supermarkets does College Town have?

Solution:
Define each Urban Residential Area 's Mitsuwa Marketplace as a; So a = 16.
Define each Urban Residential Area 's Supermarkets as X; So X = a = 16.
Define each Fashion District 's Vons as k; So k = 20 + X = 20 + 16 = 13.
Define each College Town 's Vons as M; C = k - a = 13 - 16 = 20; So M = 9 + C = 9 + 20 = 6.
Define each College Town 's Supermarkets as O; So O = M = 6.
