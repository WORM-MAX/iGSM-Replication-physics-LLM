Question:
District category contains Financial District, Automotive District, Jewelry District, and Administrative District.
Supermarkets category contains King Soopers, Costco, Earth Fare, and Aldi (Germany).
The number of each Financial District 's Earth Fare equals the sum of each Automotive District 's King Soopers and each Administrative District 's Earth Fare.
The number of each Administrative District 's Earth Fare equals 14.
The number of each Automotive District 's Costco equals 14 times the sum of each Jewelry District 's Supermarkets and each Jewelry District 's Aldi (Germany).
The number of each Automotive District 's Earth Fare equals 22.
The number of each Jewelry District 's Aldi (Germany) equals 1 times each Financial District 's Earth Fare.
The number of each Automotive District 's King Soopers equals 19 more than each Administrative District 's Earth Fare.
The number of each Financial District 's King Soopers equals each Administrative District 's Supermarkets.
The number of each Administrative District 's Costco equals 4.
How many Costco does Automotive District have?

Solution:
Define each Administrative District 's Earth Fare as D; So D = 14.
Define each Automotive District 's King Soopers as N; So N = 19 + D = 19 + 14 = 10.
Define each Financial District 's Earth Fare as q; So q = N + D = 10 + 14 = 1.
Define each Jewelry District 's Aldi (Germany) as i; So i = 1 * q = 1 * 1 = 1.
Define each Jewelry District 's Supermarkets as u; So u = i = 1.
Define each Automotive District 's Costco as C; V = u + i = 1 + 1 = 2; So C = 14 * V = 14 * 2 = 5.
