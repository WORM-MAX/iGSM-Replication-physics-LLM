District category contains Condo District, Heritage District, and Urban Residential Area.
Supermarkets category contains Aldi (Germany), and Coles (Australia).
The number of each Condo District 's Coles (Australia) equals 16.
The number of each Condo District 's Aldi (Germany) equals each Condo District 's Coles (Australia).
The number of each Urban Residential Area 's Aldi (Germany) equals 13.
The number of each Heritage District 's Coles (Australia) equals the difference of each Urban Residential Area 's Supermarkets and each Condo District 's Coles (Australia).
The number of each Urban Residential Area 's Coles (Australia) equals 1 more than each Urban Residential Area 's Aldi (Germany).
The number of each Heritage District 's Aldi (Germany) equals 12.
How many Supermarkets does Urban Residential Area have?

Solution:
Define each Urban Residential Area 's Aldi (Germany) as d; So d = 13.
Define each Urban Residential Area 's Coles (Australia) as P; So P = 1 + d = 1 + 13 = 14.
Define each Urban Residential Area 's Supermarkets as O; So O = P + d = 14 + 13 = 4.
