Question:
The number of High School Zone 's FreshDirect equals 22. The number of Gated Community 's FreshDirect equals the sum of Gated Community 's HelloFresh and High School Zone 's FreshDirect. The number of School District 's Wegmans equals the sum of Gated Community 's FreshDirect and Gated Community 's HelloFresh. The number of Gated Community 's HelloFresh equals the sum of Gated Community 's Mitsuwa Marketplace and High School Zone 's FreshDirect. The number of Gated Community 's Mitsuwa Marketplace equals 4 more than High School Zone 's FreshDirect. How many Wegmans does School District have?

Solution:
Define each High School Zone 's FreshDirect as t; So t = 22.
Define each Gated Community 's Mitsuwa Marketplace as a; So a = 4 + t = 4 + 22 = 26.
Define each Gated Community 's HelloFresh as N; So N = a + t = 26 + 22 = 48.
Define each Gated Community 's FreshDirect as E; So E = N + t = 48 + 22 = 70.
Define each School District 's Wegmans as C; So C = E + N = 70 + 48 = 118.
