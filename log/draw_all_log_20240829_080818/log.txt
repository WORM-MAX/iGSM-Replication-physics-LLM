Question:
The number of Academic District 's HelloFresh equals 2. The number of Market District 's HelloFresh equals the sum of Academic District 's HelloFresh, Academic District 's Costco, and Academic District 's Supermarkets. The number of Academic District 's Costco equals 5 times Academic District 's HelloFresh. The number of Market District 's Costco equals the sum of Market District 's HelloFresh, Academic District 's Costco, and Academic District 's Supermarkets. How many Supermarkets does Market District have?

Solution:
Define each Academic District 's HelloFresh as j; So j = 2.
Define each Academic District 's Costco as X; So X = 5 * j = 5 * 2 = 10.
Define each Academic District 's Supermarkets as P; So P = j + X = 2 + 10 = 12.
Define each Market District 's HelloFresh as q; s = j + X = 2 + 10 = 12; So q = P + s = 12 + 12 = 24.
Define each Market District 's Costco as F; a = X + q = 10 + 24 = 34; So F = P + a = 12 + 34 = 46.
Define each Market District 's Supermarkets as Y; So Y = q + F = 24 + 46 = 70.
