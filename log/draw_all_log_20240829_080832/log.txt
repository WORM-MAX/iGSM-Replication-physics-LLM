Define each Walmart 's Smoothies as Y; So Y = 3.
Define each HelloFresh 's Smoothies as v; So v = Y = 3.
Define each Walmart 's Cheesecake as k; So k = v = 3.
Define each SuperValu 's Cheesecake as H; So H = k = 3.
Define each Cultural Heritage Site 's Walmart as z; So z = H = 3.
Define each Cultural Heritage Site 's SuperValu as w; So w = Y - v = 3 - 3 = 0.
Define each Cultural Heritage Site 's Supermarkets as s; So s = z + w = 3 + 0 = 3.
Define each HelloFresh 's Cheesecake as r; So r = 6 * s = 6 * 3 = 18.
Define each Diplomatic Quarter 's HelloFresh as p; So p = 13 + r = 13 + 18 = 31.
