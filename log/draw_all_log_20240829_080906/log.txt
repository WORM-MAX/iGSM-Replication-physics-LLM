Question:
The number of Misfits Market 's Canned Fish equals Makro 's Product. The number of Makro 's Cheese Puffs equals 1. The number of Warehouse District 's Misfits Market equals 15. The number of Misfits Market 's Pastries equals the difference of Bristol Farms 's Product and Makro 's Product. The number of Bristol Farms 's Cheese Puffs equals 19 times Makro 's Product. How many Product does Warehouse District have?

Solution:
Define each Makro 's Cheese Puffs as c; So c = 1.
Define each Makro 's Product as q; So q = c = 1.
Define each Bristol Farms 's Cheese Puffs as w; So w = 19 * q = 19 * 1 = 19.
Define each Bristol Farms 's Product as m; So m = w = 19.
Define each Misfits Market 's Pastries as T; So T = m - q = 19 - 1 = 18.
Define each Misfits Market 's Canned Fish as H; So H = q = 1.
Define each Misfits Market 's Product as s; So s = T + H = 18 + 1 = 19.
Define each Warehouse District 's Misfits Market as K; So K = 15.
Define each Warehouse District 's Product as N; N = K * s = 15 * 19 = 285.
