The number of each Landmark District 's PriceRite equals the sum of each Market District 's Supermarkets and each Market District 's Stop & Shop.
The number of each Market District 's PriceRite equals 8 more than each Stop & Shop 's Canned Sauces.
How many PriceRite does Landmark District have?

Solution:
Define each Landmark District 's Stop & Shop as a; So a = 4.
Define each PriceRite 's Rice Cakes as H; So H = 5 * a = 5 * 4 = 20.
Define each Stop & Shop 's Canned Sauces as f; So f = 2 + H = 2 + 20 = 22.
Define each Stop & Shop 's Rice Cakes as T; x = f + H = 22 + 20 = 19; So T = a + x = 4 + 19 = 0.
Define each Stop & Shop 's Product as i; So i = T + f = 0 + 22 = 22.
Define each Market District 's Stop & Shop as D; So D = 6 + i = 6 + 22 = 5.
Define each Market District 's PriceRite as O; So O = 8 + f = 8 + 22 = 7.
Define each Market District 's Supermarkets as o; So o = O + D = 7 + 5 = 12.
Define each Landmark District 's PriceRite as q; So q = o + D = 12 + 5 = 17.
