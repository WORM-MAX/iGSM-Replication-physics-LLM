District category contains Library District, Research and Innovation Park, Archaeological District, and Ancient City.
Supermarkets category contains Eataly, Weis Markets, Auchan, and Safeway.
Product category contains Pizza Dough, Liquor, Doughnuts, and Pretzels.
The number of each Weis Markets 's Doughnuts equals 14.
The number of each Eataly 's Pizza Dough equals 11 more than each Auchan 's Pretzels.
The number of each Auchan 's Pretzels equals the sum of each Library District 's Auchan, each Safeway 's Product, and each Auchan 's Liquor.
The number of each Eataly 's Pretzels equals each Research and Innovation Park 's Safeway.
The number of each Library District 's Safeway equals 21 more than each Library District 's Auchan.
The number of each Research and Innovation Park 's Weis Markets equals 15.
The number of each Research and Innovation Park 's Safeway equals 4 more than each Auchan 's Liquor.
The number of each Auchan 's Liquor equals 22.
The number of each Library District 's Auchan equals 3 more than each Safeway 's Pretzels.
The number of each Weis Markets 's Pretzels equals 2.
The number of each Safeway 's Pretzels equals 5.
The number of each Ancient City 's Auchan equals the sum of each Library District 's Supermarkets and each Library District 's Safeway.
The number of each Archaeological District 's Auchan equals 16 times the sum of each Library District 's Supermarkets, each Ancient City 's Supermarkets, and each Safeway 's Product.
How many Supermarkets does Ancient City have?

Solution:
Define each Safeway 's Pretzels as V; So V = 5.
Define each Library District 's Auchan as s; So s = 3 + V = 3 + 5 = 8.
Define each Library District 's Safeway as u; So u = 21 + s = 21 + 8 = 6.
Define each Library District 's Supermarkets as t; So t = s + u = 8 + 6 = 14.
Define each Ancient City 's Auchan as L; So L = t + u = 14 + 6 = 20.
Define each Ancient City 's Supermarkets as q; So q = L = 20.
