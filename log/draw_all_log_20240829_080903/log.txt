Question:
The number of Fruit Snacks 's Sorghum equals 7. The number of Fruit Snacks 's Coconut Oil equals the sum of Cream Cheese 's Coconut Oil, Fruit Snacks 's Sorghum, and Cream Cheese 's Ingredient. The number of Cream Cheese 's Coconut Oil equals 11 times Fruit Snacks 's Sorghum. The number of Cream Cheese 's Sorghum equals 6 times Cream Cheese 's Coconut Oil. How many Coconut Oil does Fruit Snacks have?

Solution:
Define each Fruit Snacks 's Sorghum as e; So e = 7.
Define each Cream Cheese 's Coconut Oil as y; So y = 11 * e = 11 * 7 = 77.
Define each Cream Cheese 's Sorghum as w; So w = 6 * y = 6 * 77 = 462.
Define each Cream Cheese 's Ingredient as H; So H = y + w = 77 + 462 = 539.
Define each Fruit Snacks 's Coconut Oil as p; g = y + e = 77 + 7 = 84; So p = H + g = 539 + 84 = 623.
