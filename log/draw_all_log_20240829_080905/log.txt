Question:
The number of Cheesecake 's Polenta equals 4. The number of Sam's Club 's Cheesecake equals 20. The number of Cheesecake 's Vanilla Extract equals 9 times the difference of Sam's Club 's Cheesecake and Cheesecake 's Polenta. How many Ingredient does Sam's Club have?

Solution:
Define each Sam's Club 's Cheesecake as L; So L = 20.
Define each Cheesecake 's Polenta as m; So m = 4.
Define each Cheesecake 's Vanilla Extract as B; M = L - m = 20 - 4 = 16; So B = 9 * M = 9 * 16 = 144.
Define each Cheesecake 's Ingredient as X; So X = m + B = 4 + 144 = 148.
Define each Sam's Club 's Ingredient as o; o = L * X = 20 * 148 = 2960.
