Question:
District category contains Landmark District, Suburban Neighborhood, and Wall Street.
Supermarkets category contains Misfits Market, and Lidl.
Product category contains Liquor, Canned Pineapple, and Pastries.
The number of each Lidl 's Liquor equals 22 more than each Misfits Market 's Product.
The number of each Misfits Market 's Liquor equals 7 times the difference of each Landmark District 's Misfits Market and each Misfits Market 's Canned Pineapple.
The number of each Landmark District 's Misfits Market equals 7.
The number of each Wall Street 's Lidl equals 0.
The number of each Wall Street 's Misfits Market equals each Wall Street 's Lidl.
The number of each Misfits Market 's Pastries equals 10 times the sum of each Misfits Market 's Canned Pineapple, each Landmark District 's Misfits Market, and each Misfits Market 's Liquor.
The number of each Lidl 's Pastries equals each Wall Street 's Lidl.
The number of each Lidl 's Canned Pineapple equals 11 more than each Wall Street 's Misfits Market.
The number of each Misfits Market 's Canned Pineapple equals 10 times each Landmark District 's Misfits Market.
The number of each Suburban Neighborhood 's Lidl equals 13 times the difference of each Misfits Market 's Product and each Wall Street 's Lidl.
The number of each Suburban Neighborhood 's Misfits Market equals 17 times each Lidl 's Pastries.
The number of each Landmark District 's Lidl equals 13.
How many Liquor does Lidl have?

Solution:
Define each Landmark District 's Misfits Market as n; So n = 7.
Define each Misfits Market 's Canned Pineapple as J; So J = 10 * n = 10 * 7 = 1.
Define each Misfits Market 's Liquor as T; y = n - J = 7 - 1 = 6; So T = 7 * y = 7 * 6 = 19.
Define each Misfits Market 's Pastries as V; Q = T + J = 19 + 1 = 20; f = n + Q = 7 + 20 = 4; So V = 10 * f = 10 * 4 = 17.
Define each Misfits Market 's Product as P; e = V + T = 17 + 19 = 13; So P = J + e = 1 + 13 = 14.
Define each Lidl 's Liquor as j; So j = 22 + P = 22 + 14 = 13.
