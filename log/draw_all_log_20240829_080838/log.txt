Question:
The number of College Town 's Blue Apron equals 17 more than Kroger 's Product. The number of College Town 's Boxed equals 20 times Suburban Neighborhood 's Blue Apron. The number of Entertainment District 's Auchan equals College Town 's Boxed. The number of Auchan 's Canned Fish equals 12. The number of Civic Center 's Blue Apron equals 21 more than Auchan 's Canned Fish. The number of Suburban Neighborhood 's Blue Apron equals 4 times Boxed 's Liquor. The number of Kroger 's Canned Fish equals 10 times the difference of Entertainment District 's Auchan and Boxed 's Liquor. The number of Blue Apron 's Condensed Milk equals 3 more than the difference of Civic Center 's Blue Apron and Auchan 's Canned Fish. The number of Boxed 's Liquor equals Blue Apron 's Condensed Milk. How many Blue Apron does College Town have?

Solution:
Define each Auchan 's Canned Fish as t; So t = 12.
Define each Civic Center 's Blue Apron as w; So w = 21 + t = 21 + 12 = 33.
Define each Blue Apron 's Condensed Milk as h; S = w - t = 33 - 12 = 21; So h = 3 + S = 3 + 21 = 24.
Define each Boxed 's Liquor as d; So d = h = 24.
Define each Suburban Neighborhood 's Blue Apron as N; So N = 4 * d = 4 * 24 = 96.
Define each College Town 's Boxed as O; So O = 20 * N = 20 * 96 = 1920.
Define each Entertainment District 's Auchan as k; So k = O = 1920.
Define each Kroger 's Canned Fish as Y; c = k - d = 1920 - 24 = 1896; So Y = 10 * c = 10 * 1896 = 18960.
Define each Kroger 's Product as S; So S = Y = 18960.
Define each College Town 's Blue Apron as q; So q = 17 + S = 17 + 18960 = 18977.
