District category contains Wall Street, Condo District, and College Town.
Supermarkets category contains Dollar General, H-E-B, and Big Lots.
Product category contains Yogurt Covered Raisins, Cheese, and Cheesecake.
Ingredient category contains Polenta, Condensed Milk, and Barley.
The number of each Big Lots 's Cheesecake equals 19.
The number of each Cheesecake 's Polenta equals 6 more than the difference of each Yogurt Covered Raisins 's Polenta and each Cheese 's Polenta.
The number of each College Town 's Big Lots equals 14.
The number of each Condo District 's H-E-B equals each Cheese 's Polenta.
The number of each Wall Street 's Big Lots equals 19 more than each Cheesecake 's Polenta.
The number of each Yogurt Covered Raisins 's Polenta equals each Cheese 's Polenta.
The number of each Cheese 's Polenta equals 10.
The number of each Dollar General 's Cheesecake equals 0.
The number of each H-E-B 's Yogurt Covered Raisins equals the sum of each Cheesecake 's Polenta, each Wall Street 's Big Lots, each Yogurt Covered Raisins 's Polenta, and each Cheese 's Polenta.
How many Product does Condo District have?

Solution:
Define each Cheese 's Polenta as D; So D = 10.
Define each Yogurt Covered Raisins 's Polenta as m; So m = D = 10.
Define each Cheesecake 's Polenta as U; b = m - D = 10 - 10 = 0; So U = 6 + b = 6 + 0 = 6.
Define each Wall Street 's Big Lots as d; So d = 19 + U = 19 + 6 = 2.
Define each H-E-B 's Yogurt Covered Raisins as W; l = U + D = 6 + 10 = 16; a = l + m = 16 + 10 = 3; So W = d + a = 2 + 3 = 5.
Define each H-E-B 's Product as a; So a = W = 5.
Define each Condo District 's H-E-B as r; So r = D = 10.
Define each Condo District 's Product as q; q = r * a = 10 * 5 = 4.
