Question:
The number of Morrisons 's Protein Shakes equals 16 more than Food 4 Less 's Ice Cream. The number of Institute District 's Morrisons equals the difference of Morrisons 's Product and Morrisons 's Protein Shakes. The number of Food 4 Less 's Ice Cream equals 7. How many Morrisons does Institute District have?

Solution:
Define each Food 4 Less 's Ice Cream as Q; So Q = 7.
Define each Morrisons 's Protein Shakes as G; So G = 16 + Q = 16 + 7 = 23.
Define each Morrisons 's Product as m; So m = G = 23.
Define each Institute District 's Morrisons as o; So o = m - G = 23 - 23 = 0.
