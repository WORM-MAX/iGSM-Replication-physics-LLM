Question:
The number of Heritage District 's Auchan equals 4. The number of Arts District 's Coles (Australia) equals 10 times Heritage District 's Sam's Club. The number of Heritage District 's Sam's Club equals the difference of Manufacturing District 's Auchan and Heritage District 's Auchan. The number of Manufacturing District 's Auchan equals 1 times Heritage District 's Auchan. How many Coles (Australia) does Arts District have?

Solution:
Define each Heritage District 's Auchan as A; So A = 4.
Define each Manufacturing District 's Auchan as E; So E = 1 * A = 1 * 4 = 4.
Define each Heritage District 's Sam's Club as x; So x = E - A = 4 - 4 = 0.
Define each Arts District 's Coles (Australia) as V; So V = 10 * x = 10 * 0 = 0.
