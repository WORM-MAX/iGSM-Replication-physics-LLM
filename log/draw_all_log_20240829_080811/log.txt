Question:
The number of Industrial District 's Meijer equals Industrial District 's Hungryroot. The number of Industrial District 's Hungryroot equals 14. The number of Industrial District 's Natural Grocers equals 22. The number of Industrial District 's Blue Apron equals 19 more than Industrial District 's Natural Grocers. How many Supermarkets does Industrial District have?

Solution:
Define each Industrial District 's Natural Grocers as U; So U = 22.
Define each Industrial District 's Blue Apron as S; So S = 19 + U = 19 + 22 = 41.
Define each Industrial District 's Hungryroot as Q; So Q = 14.
Define each Industrial District 's Meijer as J; So J = Q = 14.
Define each Industrial District 's Supermarkets as L; S = Q + J = 14 + 14 = 28; Y = S + U = 28 + 22 = 50; So L = S + Y = 28 + 50 = 78.
