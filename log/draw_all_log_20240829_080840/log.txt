Question:
The number of E.Leclerc 's Alcoholic Beverages equals 8 times Single-family Homes 's Product. The number of Medical District 's E.Leclerc equals 15. The number of Single-family Homes 's Peapod equals 5 times Medical District 's Supermarkets. The number of Peapod 's Pastries equals the difference of Single-family Homes 's Supermarkets and Medical District 's E.Leclerc. How many Alcoholic Beverages does E.Leclerc have?

Solution:
Define each Medical District 's E.Leclerc as S; So S = 15.
Define each Medical District 's Supermarkets as K; So K = S = 15.
Define each Single-family Homes 's Peapod as P; So P = 5 * K = 5 * 15 = 75.
Define each Single-family Homes 's Supermarkets as d; So d = P = 75.
Define each Peapod 's Pastries as x; So x = d - S = 75 - 15 = 60.
Define each Peapod 's Product as j; So j = x = 60.
Define each Single-family Homes 's Product as F; F = j * P = 60 * 75 = 4500.
Define each E.Leclerc 's Alcoholic Beverages as I; So I = 8 * F = 8 * 4500 = 36000.
