The number of Capitol District 's Sprouts Farmers Market equals 21 times Sprouts Farmers Market 's Evaporated Milk. The number of King Soopers 's Canned Pasta equals 5 more than King Soopers 's Tortillas. The number of Sprouts Farmers Market 's Evaporated Milk equals 14. The number of King Soopers 's Tortillas equals 6 times King Soopers 's Evaporated Milk. The number of Capitol District 's King Soopers equals the difference of Sprouts Farmers Market 's Evaporated Milk and King Soopers 's Product. The number of Jewelry District 's Sprouts Farmers Market equals Capitol District 's Product. The number of King Soopers 's Evaporated Milk equals 2. How many Sprouts Farmers Market does Jewelry District have?

Solution:
Define each King Soopers 's Evaporated Milk as g; So g = 2.
Define each King Soopers 's Tortillas as S; So S = 6 * g = 6 * 2 = 12.
Define each King Soopers 's Canned Pasta as K; So K = 5 + S = 5 + 12 = 17.
Define each King Soopers 's Product as P; n = K + S = 17 + 12 = 29; So P = g + n = 2 + 29 = 31.
Define each Sprouts Farmers Market 's Evaporated Milk as i; So i = 14.
Define each Sprouts Farmers Market 's Product as O; So O = i = 14.
Define each Capitol District 's King Soopers as j; So j = i - P = -17 - 31 = -17.
Define each Capitol District 's Sprouts Farmers Market as a; So a = 21 * i = 21 * -17 = -357.
Define each Capitol District 's Product as o; k = j * O = -17 * 14 = -238; T = a * P = -357 * 31 = -11067; So o = k + T = -238 + -11067 = -11305.
Define each Jewelry District 's Sprouts Farmers Market as R; So R = o = -11305.
