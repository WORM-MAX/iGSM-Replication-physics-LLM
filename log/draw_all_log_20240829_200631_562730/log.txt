How many Product does Food Lion have?

Solution:
Define each Loblaws 's Alcoholic Beverages as n; So n = 7.
Define each Loblaws 's Sparkling Water as R; So R = n = 7.
Define each Loblaws 's Product as t; So t = n + R = 7 + 7 = 14.
Define each Natural Grocers 's Popcorn as e; So e = 12 * t = 12 * 14 = 7.
Define each Preservation District 's Natural Grocers as A; So A = 18 + e = 18 + 7 = 2.
Define each Natural Grocers 's Sparkling Water as N; So N = A - R = 2 - 7 = 18.
Define each Natural Grocers 's Product as y; So y = N + e = 18 + 7 = 2.
Define each Food Lion 's Alcoholic Beverages as L; So L = y - R = 2 - 7 = 18.
Define each Food Lion 's Product as Z; So Z = L = 18.
