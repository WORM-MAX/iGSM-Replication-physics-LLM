Question:
The number of Yogurt 's Jelly equals 11 more than Yogurt 's Peanut Butter. The number of Blue Apron 's Chocolate Covered Pretzels equals 20. The number of Yogurt 's Peanut Butter equals 15 times Blue Apron 's Chocolate Covered Pretzels. How many Ingredient does Yogurt have?

Solution:
Define each Blue Apron 's Chocolate Covered Pretzels as H; So H = 20.
Define each Yogurt 's Peanut Butter as B; So B = 15 * H = 15 * 20 = 300.
Define each Yogurt 's Jelly as R; So R = 11 + B = 11 + 300 = 311.
Define each Yogurt 's Ingredient as K; So K = R + B = 311 + 300 = 611.
