Question:
The number of Food Lion's Bottled Water equals 13 times Capitol District's Instacart. The number of Buns's Bulgur equals Food Lion's Bottled Water. The number of Capitol District's Instacart equals 2. How many Bulgur does Buns have?

Solution:
Define each Capitol District's Instacart as Z; So Z = 2.
Define each Food Lion's Bottled Water as o; So o = 13 * Z = 13 * 2 = 26.
Define each Buns's Bulgur as s; So s = o = 26.
