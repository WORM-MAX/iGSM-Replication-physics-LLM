Question:
The number of Preservation District 's Weis Markets equals 2. The number of Single-family Homes 's Weis Markets equals 17 times Preservation District 's Weis Markets. The number of Single-family Homes 's Food Lion equals 6 times the sum of Preservation District 's Weis Markets and Single-family Homes 's Weis Markets. The number of Preservation District 's Food Lion equals 20 more than the sum of Single-family Homes 's Supermarkets, Single-family Homes 's Weis Markets, and Preservation District 's Weis Markets. How many Food Lion does Preservation District have?

Solution:
Define each Preservation District 's Weis Markets as o; So o = 2.
Define each Single-family Homes 's Weis Markets as C; So C = 17 * o = 17 * 2 = 34.
Define each Single-family Homes 's Food Lion as X; H = o + C = 2 + 34 = 36; So X = 6 * H = 6 * 36 = 216.
Define each Single-family Homes 's Supermarkets as g; So g = C + X = 34 + 216 = 250.
Define each Preservation District 's Food Lion as a; D = C + o = 34 + 2 = 36; j = g + D = 250 + 36 = 286; So a = 20 + j = 20 + 286 = 306.
