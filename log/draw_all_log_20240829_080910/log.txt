Question:
The number of Capitol District 's Peapod equals 3 times Peapod 's Bread. The number of Instacart 's Bread equals 19 times Capitol District 's Product. The number of Peapod 's Bread equals 7 more than Peapod 's Custard. The number of Peapod 's Custard equals 8. The number of Research Park 's Instacart equals 13 more than Instacart 's Product. How many Product does Research Park have?

Solution:
Define each Peapod 's Custard as i; So i = 8.
Define each Peapod 's Bread as W; So W = 7 + i = 7 + 8 = 15.
Define each Peapod 's Product as R; So R = i + W = 8 + 15 = 23.
Define each Capitol District 's Peapod as M; So M = 3 * W = 3 * 15 = 45.
Define each Capitol District 's Product as q; q = R * M = 23 * 45 = 1035.
Define each Instacart 's Bread as J; So J = 19 * q = 19 * 1035 = 19665.
Define each Instacart 's Product as g; So g = J = 19665.
Define each Research Park 's Instacart as m; So m = 13 + g = 13 + 19665 = 19678.
Define each Research Park 's Product as e; e = m * g = 19678 * 19665 = 386967870.

Question:
The number of Capitol District 's Peapod equals 16 times Peapod 's Bread. The number of Peapod 's Bread equals 10 more than Peapod 's Custard. The number of Peapod 's Custard equals 13. The number of Instacart 's Bread equals 2 more than Capitol District 's Product. The number of Research Park 's Instacart equals 0 more than Instacart 's Product. How many Product does Research Park have?

Solution:
Define each Peapod 's Custard as m; So m = 13.
Define each Peapod 's Bread as Y; So Y = 10 + m = 10 + 13 = 23.
Define each Peapod 's Product as L; So L = m + Y = 13 + 23 = 36.
Define each Capitol District 's Peapod as E; So E = 16 * Y = 16 * 23 = 368.
Define each Capitol District 's Product as X; X = E * L = 368 * 36 = 13248.
Define each Instacart 's Bread as D; So D = 2 + X = 2 + 13248 = 13250.
Define each Instacart 's Product as I; So I = D = 13250.
Define each Research Park 's Instacart as d; So d = 0 + I = 0 + 13250 = 13250.
Define each Research Park 's Product as V; V = d * I = 13250 * 13250 = 175562500.
