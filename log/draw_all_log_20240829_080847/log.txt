Question:
The number of Shopping District 's Save-A-Lot equals 18 more than Old Town 's Carrefour. The number of Old Town 's Carrefour equals 7. The number of Old Town 's Costco equals Diplomatic Quarter 's Dollar General. The number of Colonial District 's Costco equals 19. The number of Diplomatic Quarter 's Dollar General equals 11 times the difference of Colonial District 's Costco and Diplomatic Quarter 's Carrefour. The number of Diplomatic Quarter 's Carrefour equals 0 times the sum of Shopping District 's Save-A-Lot, Colonial District 's Costco, and Old Town 's Carrefour. The number of Diplomatic Quarter 's Save-A-Lot equals the sum of Colonial District 's Costco, Old Town 's Costco, Diplomatic Quarter 's Carrefour, and Diplomatic Quarter 's Dollar General. How many Supermarkets does Diplomatic Quarter have?

Solution:
Define each Old Town 's Carrefour as A; So A = 7.
Define each Shopping District 's Save-A-Lot as u; So u = 18 + A = 18 + 7 = 25.
Define each Colonial District 's Costco as Q; So Q = 19.
Define each Diplomatic Quarter 's Carrefour as D; b = Q + A = 19 + 7 = 26; r = u + b = 25 + 26 = 51; So D = 0 * r = 0 * 51 = 0.
Define each Diplomatic Quarter 's Dollar General as B; m = Q - D = 19 - 0 = 19; So B = 11 * m = 11 * 19 = 209.
Define each Old Town 's Costco as x; So x = B = 209.
Define each Diplomatic Quarter 's Save-A-Lot as O; P = D + B = 0 + 209 = 209; N = P + Q = 209 + 19 = 228; So O = x + N = 209 + 228 = 437.
Define each Diplomatic Quarter 's Supermarkets as P; s = D + B = 0 + 209 = 209; So P = O + s = 437 + 209 = 646.
