Question:
The number of Media District 's Vons equals the difference of Wall Street 's Amazon Fresh and Media District 's Hungryroot. The number of Wall Street 's Hungryroot equals 10 more than Municipal Office District 's Hungryroot. The number of Municipal Office District 's Hungryroot equals 20 times Media District 's Amazon Fresh. The number of Media District 's Hungryroot equals Wall Street 's Hungryroot. The number of Wall Street 's Amazon Fresh equals 4 times the sum of Media District 's Hungryroot and Wall Street 's Hungryroot. The number of Media District 's Amazon Fresh equals 0. How many Vons does Media District have?

Solution:
Define each Media District 's Amazon Fresh as I; So I = 0.
Define each Municipal Office District 's Hungryroot as u; So u = 20 * I = 20 * 0 = 0.
Define each Wall Street 's Hungryroot as j; So j = 10 + u = 10 + 0 = 10.
Define each Media District 's Hungryroot as X; So X = j = 10.
Define each Wall Street 's Amazon Fresh as p; S = X + j = 10 + 10 = 20; So p = 4 * S = 4 * 20 = 80.
Define each Media District 's Vons as K; So K = p - X = 80 - 10 = 70.
