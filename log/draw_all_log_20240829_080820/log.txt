Question:
The number of ShopRite 's Pastries equals 20 times ShopRite 's Cupcakes. The number of ShopRite 's Cupcakes equals 22. How many Product does ShopRite have?

Solution:
Define each ShopRite 's Cupcakes as V; So V = 22.
Define each ShopRite 's Pastries as t; So t = 20 * V = 20 * 22 = 440.
Define each ShopRite 's Product as Z; So Z = V + t = 22 + 440 = 462.
